are the arc-shaped diffuse radio emission regions observed in the outskirts \
of some merging galaxy clusters. They are believed to trace shock-waves in \
the intra-cluster medium. Recent observations  demonstrated that some \
prominent radio relics exhibit a steepening above 2 GHz in their radio \
spectrum. This challenges standard theoretical models because shock \
acceleration is expected to accelerate electrons to very high energies with a \
power-law distribution in momentum. In this work we attempt to reconcile \
these data with the shock-acceleration scenario. We propose that the spectral \
steepening may be  caused by the highest energy electrons emitting \
preferentially in lower magnetic fields than the bulk of synchrotron bright \
electrons in relics. Here, we focus on a model with an increasing magnetic \
field behind the shock front, which quickly saturates and then declines. We \
derive the time-evolution of cosmic-ray electron spectra in time variable \
magnetic fields and an expanding medium. We then apply the formalism on the \
large radio relic in the cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 (the Sausage relic). We \
show that under favourable circumstances of magnetic field amplification \
downstream, our model can explain the observed radio spectrum, the brightness \
profile and the spectral index profile of the relic. \\nA possible \
interpretation for the required amplification of the magnetic field \
downstream is a dynamo acting behind the shock with an injection scale of \
magnetic turbulence of about 10 kpc. Our models require injection \
efficiencies of CRe - which are in tension with simple diffusive shock \
acceleration from the thermal pool. We show that this problem can likely be \
alleviated considering pre-existing \
CRe.\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n\\\\begin{keywords}\\n\\tacceleration of \

intro}\\n\\nGalaxy clusters are the largest bound structures in the \
cosmological matter distribution, with masses of a up to few $10^{15} \\\\,\\\
\\mathrm{M}_\\\\mathrm{sol}$ \\\\citep{2012ARA&A..50..353K}. In their massive \
Dark Matter dominated gravitational potential, baryons accumulate to form the \
intra-cluster-medium (ICM).  The ICM is a hot, thin plasma and makes clusters \
bright X-ray sources \\\\citep{1971Natur.231..107M,1988xrec.book.....S}. \
Observations of these sources reveal a medium behaving collisional on small \
scales, with complex features such as steep density gradients, cold fronts \
and shocks  \\\\citep{2007PhR...443....1M}. The features are probably caused \
by cluster mergers, which dissipate potential energy in the ICM and drive \
shocks and turbulence in the otherwise nearly isothermal cluster atmosphere. \
\\\\par\\n \\nThe intra-cluster-medium also hosts non-thermal components: \
cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) and magnetic fields at the $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ \
level.  In some clusters, this is prominently evidenced by diffuse steep \
spectrum radio synchrotron sources \
\\\\citep{2012A&ARv..20...54F,2014IJMPD..2330007B}. These radio sources are \
commonly classified as giant radio halos and giant radio relics: \
\\\\emph{radio halos} are characterised as diffuse unpolarised Mpc-sized \
emission centered on the X-ray emission from the ICM. In contrast, \
\\\\emph{radio relics} are strongly polarised elongated radio sources at the \
outskirts of clusters. Their formation mechanism is believed to be very \
different: radio halos are probably associated with merger-driven turbulence \
and the subsequent re-acceleration of a cluster-wide radio dark cosmic-ray \
electron population \\\\citep{2014IJMPD..2330007B}. On the other hand, radio \
relics are probably connected to merger-driven low Mach number shocks and the \
subsequent acceleration of CRe by the shock \
\\\\citep{2012SSRv..166..187B,2014IJMPD..2330007B}.  \\\\par\\n\\nGiant radio \
relics have been a subject of intense study. There are about 40 radio relics \
known to date, all connected to merging clusters \
\\\\citep{2012A&ARv..20...54F}. Some of them occur in pairs as double relics \
\\\\citep{2012MNRAS.426...40B,2015MNRAS.453.3483D}, some are connected to \
radio haloes \
\\\\citep{2015MNRAS.449.1486S,2012A&A...546A.124V,2005ApJ...627..733M,\
2016arXiv160106029V}, many are connected to radio galaxies and show an \
irregular, complex morphology \\\\citep[e.g.][]{2013ApJ...769..101V}.  \
\\\\par\\n\\nTheoretical models for radio relics assume particle acceleration \
at the shock to inject cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) into the ICM, which \
subsequently lose energy through inverse Compton and synchrotron losses and \
emit synchrotron radiation \\\\citep{1998A&A...332..395E}. A similar model, \
based on diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) from the thermal pool, \
successfully explains the non-thermal emission in supernova remnant (SNR) \
shocks, however at much higher Mach numbers of about 100 \
\\\\citep{1949PhRv...75.1169F, 1987PhR...154....1B}. Observations of SNR show \
that high-Mach number shocks in these environment accelerates many more \
protons than electrons \\\\citep{2012A&A...538A..81M,2015ApJ...798L..28C}. \
The energy density of accelerated CRp commonly exceeds the CRe energy density \
by a factor of ten to 100. \\\\par\\n \\nIn clusters however, this picture is \
challenged by the large efficiencies required to reproduce the total radio \
synchrotron brightness of many relics \\\\citep[see ][ for a \
review]{2014IJMPD..2330007B}. In cluster relics this scenario would predict \
that CRp induced $\\\\gamma$-ray emission exceeds the tight upper limits set \
by the FERMI satellite \\\\citep{2014MNRAS.437.2291V,2014ApJ...787...18A}.  \
\\\\par\\nTo alleviate the large requirements for acceleration efficiencies \
of CRe, recent models for cluster relics assume shock re-acceleration of a \
pre-existing population of CRe \
\\\\citep{2012ApJ...756...97K,2013ApJ...764...95K,2015MNRAS.451.2198V,\
2013MNRAS.435.1061P,2014ApJ...788..142K,2005ApJ...627..733M}. However, the \
absence of CRp-induced $\\\\gamma$-ray emission in clusters remains puzzling \
\\\\citep{2014IJMPD..2330007B}. CRp are expected to be subject to shock \
re-acceleration as well and hence should be $\\\\gamma$-ray bright. Relic \
models commonly employ comparatively large magnetic fields in the emission \
region, usually from $1-7\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$. Lower limits to the \
magnetic field strength were found from IC limits of up to \
$4\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ in some clusters \\\\citep{2010ApJ...715.1143F}. \
Observations now also suggest a filamentary structure of the post-shock field \
on scales above 100 kpc \\\\citep{2016arXiv160106029V,2014ApJ...794...24O}. \
Furthermore, the polarization of many relics has lead to the view that the \
required magnetic field amplification originates from shock compression. \
However, magnetic field amplification has not been studied in great detail \\\
\\citep[see however][]{2012MNRAS.423.2781I}, and downstream magnetic field \
decay has never been discussed in the literature.  \\\\par\\n\\nThe prototype \
of radio relics is probably the northern relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301 \
\\\\citep{2010Sci...330..347V}. Its large extension of 2 Mpc, very narrow \
brightness profile with an FWHM of 55 kpc at 610 MHz and homogeneous \
brightness distribution have coined the term ''Sausage relic''. The data \
provide direct evidence for a large shock and subsequent CRe cooling at the \
outskirts of the cluster. Its simplicity has made the cluster a preferred \
target for the study of shock acceleration in the ICM. The cluster hosts \
another morphologically irregular counter relic in the south that is possibly \
connected to a few radio galaxies \\\\citep{2013A&A...555A.110S}.     \\\\par\
\\n\\nRecently, \\\\citet{2014MNRAS.441L..41S,2016MNRAS.455.2402S} discovered \
spectral steepening beyond 2 GHz in the radio spectrum of the northern relic \
and the ''Toothbrush'' relic, the same was also found in A2256 by \
\\\\citet{2015A&A...575A..45T}. This new constraint appears to \
\\\\emph{fundamentally contradict} the standard picture for the formation of \
radio relics, which predicts a power-law up to very high frequencies \
\\\\citep{1998A&A...332..395E, 2015ApJ...809..186K}. In case of the northern \
relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301, the observed emission at 30 GHz is more than a \
factor 15 below the simple power-law model used to fit the low frequencies \\\
\\citep{2010Sci...330..347V}.   \\\\citet{2015ApJ...809..186K} conclude that \
the steepening is unlikely caused by the re-acceleration of a pre-existing \
CRe population. \\\\citet{2015arXiv151103245B} suggest that the steepening \
can be attributed to the SZ decrement, however only for steep radio spectra \
corresponding to Mach numbers below three. \\\\citet{2016arXiv160203278K} \
considered a scenario where a shock has crossed a cloud of finite extend and \
the relic emission originates from aged CR electrons. They conclude that this \
could lead to the observed steepening in the spectrum. In any case, our \
understanding of radio relics has been shaken by the Sausage relic alone: \
Neither exists a satisfactory model for its radio spectrum, nor do we \
understand the mechanism leading to the high magnetic field value required in \
current models. \\\\par\\n\\nIn this article, we attempt to solve this \
discrepancy by exploring the possibility that the steepening in the spectrum \
of relics is indicative of higher energy CRe emitting in a lower magnetic \
field, hence significantly reducing the total emission at high frequencies. \
This could be caused by a number of physical situations, among them slow \
magnetic field amplification directly behind the shock or diffusion of \
preferentially high energy CRe into regions with low magnetic field.  \\\\par\
\\n \\nWe focus this work on effects from time-dependent magnetic fields and \
adiabatic expansion of the thermal gas behind the shock. We neglect other \
effects like CR diffusion, reconnection and the possibly pre-existing CRe \
distribution \\\\citep{2015ApJ...809..186K}, for simplicity. We show that \
under favourable conditions for the evolution of the magnetic field \
downstream, it is possible to model the spectral properties and brightness \
distribution observed in this relic. Magnetic fields and their amplification \
in or behind collisionless shocks in the outskirts of clusters are not well \
understood or constrained, in fact the problem has been largely ignored in \
the literature \\\\citep[see however][]{2012MNRAS.423.2781I}. Hence an \
empirical model can yield constrains on the magnetic field evolution at \
shocks at the cluster outskirts. As motivated above, the simple structure of \
the northern radio relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301, its potentially high Mach \
number and the excellent available radio data make it the ideal target for \
this investigation.\\\\par\\n \\nThis work will require to calculate the \
synchrotron brightness of CRe cooling in a time-variable magnetic field and \
adiabatic expansion. We develop this formalism in the next section.  In \
section \\\\ref{sect:model}, we review the recent state-of-the-art \
observations of the cluster to set reasonable parameters for the shock. We \
also describe four magnetic field models in the downstream region, which we \
chose \\\\emph{empirically to fit the data} (we explore the parameter space \
of these models in appendix \\\\ref{app.parameters}). We compare the model \
with observations in section \\\\ref{sect:results}.  The discussion and \
interpretation of the results is put forward in section \
\\\\ref{sect:discussion}. Our summary is reported in section \
\\\\ref{sect.conlusions}.  \\n \\nThroughout the paper, we assume a standard \
$\\\\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmology, with $H_0 = 70\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km}\\\\, \
\\\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\\\\Omega_\\\\mathrm{M} = 0.3$ and \
$\\\\Omega_\\\\Lambda = 0.7$. Hence, at the redshift of the cluster, $1 \\\\,\
\\\\mathrm{arcmin} = 192\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc}$, this means a luminosity \
distance of $d_\\\\mathrm{lum} \\\\approx 930 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{Mpc}$.\\n \\n\\\
\\section{Scenario \\\\& Formalism} \\\\label{sect:formalism}\\n\\nHere we \
explore an extension of the standard theoretical scenario for radio relics \
evaluating the changes in the observed radio spectrum induced by the \
evolution of the magnetic field in the downstream region. The goal is to \
scrutinize whether these effects can explain the steepening observed at high \
frequencies in the integrated spectrum of some radio relics. \\\\\\\\\\nWe \
assume the following steps :\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\t\\\\item Cosmic-ray \
electrons are accelerated or re-accelerated at the shock via DSA with a \
power-law spectrum. We assume the usual dependency of acceleration efficiency \
with Mach number \\\\citep{1987PhR...154....1B}.\\n\\t\\\\item Cosmic-ray \
electrons evolve and cool downstream, also due to adiabatic \
expansion.\\n\\t\\\\item The magnetic field is gradually amplified downstream \
and then declines with increasing distance from the shock. Amplification by \
compression in the shock is relevant only so far, as it sets the initial \
field in our model: \
$B_\\\\mathrm{min}$.\\n\\\\end{enumerate}\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Adiabatic \
Expansion behind an ICM Shock}\\\\label{sect.adexp}\\n\\nBehind a shock in \
the ICM, the thermal plasma with number density $n_\\\\mathrm{th}$ is going \
to settle into the gravitational potential of the cluster atmosphere, \
subsequently expanding. As a simple first model for this process, we assume \
that this expansion is only one-dimensional along the shock normal with \
velocity $v_\\\\mathrm{exp}$ away from the shock on a time scale of \
$t_\\\\mathrm{exp}$, which in turn increases the downstream velocity \
($v_\\\\mathrm{dw}$) as a function of time and distance from the shock \
($r(t)$): \\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tv_\\\\mathrm{dw}(t) &= v_\\\\mathrm{dw,0} \
e^{\\\\frac{t}{t_\\\\mathrm{exp}}} \\\\\\\\\\n\\tv_\\\\mathrm{exp}(t) &=  \
v_\\\\mathrm{dw,0} \\\\left(e^{\\\\frac{t}{t_\\\\mathrm{exp}}} - 1 \\\\right) \
\\\\\\\\\\n\\tr(t) &= v_\\\\mathrm{dw,0} t_\\\\mathrm{exp} \
\\\\left(e^{\\\\frac{t}{t_\\\\mathrm{exp}}} - 1\\\\right) \
\\\\\\\\\\n\\tn_\\\\mathrm{th}(t) &= n_\\\\mathrm{th,0} \
e^{-\\\\frac{t}{t_\\\\mathrm{exp}}}, \
\\\\label{eq.AdExNth}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere the downstream velocity at \
$t=0$ is $v_\\\\mathrm{dw}(0) = c_\\\\mathrm{s,up} M / \\\\sigma$, with the \
upstream sound speed $c_\\\\mathrm{s,up}$, Mach number $M$ and the \
compression factor $\\\\sigma$ (see table \\\\ref{tab.sausage}). The \
expansion formally lasts until $t = t_\\\\mathrm{exp} \\\\mathrm{ln}\\\\left( \
v_\\\\mathrm{up} / v_\\\\mathrm{dw,0} \\\\right)$, i.e. $v_\\\\mathrm{dw} = \
v_\\\\mathrm{up}$. However, as the ICM density is stratified, expansion will \
likely seize long before this time. As usual, for a frozen in magnetic field: \
$B(t) \\\\propto n_\\\\mathrm{th}^{2/3}$ during the \
expansion.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Cosmic-ray Electron Evolution} \
\\\\label{sect:lifetimes}\\n\\nIn the downstream region, a population of CR \
electrons can be described by its \\\\emph{isotropic} spectrum in number \
density $n(p,t)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}p$ over momentum  $p = E/c$ (in the \
ultra-relativistic limit).  The time-evolution of this spectrum is  given by \
the diffusion-loss equation \\\\citep[see e.g.][ for a pedagogic \
introduction]{2011hea..book.....L}:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\frac{\\\\\
mathrm{d}n(p,t)}{\\\\mathrm{d}p} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial p} \
\\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\left. \
\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}p}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\right|_\\\\mathrm{loss} + \
\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}p}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\right|_\\\\mathrm{AE} \
\\\\right) n(p,t) \\\\right] + Q(p,t), \\\\label{eq:cre_spectrum} \
\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere  we neglect spatial diffusion and non-linear \
momentum diffusion as well as escape. \\\\par\\nCRe are subject to a number \
of energy losses. In radio relics, radiative losses through inverse Compton \
scattering with CMB photons and synchrotron emission due to the ambient \
magnetic field $B(t)$ are dominant at synchrotron bright momenta (see also \
figure \\\\ref{fig:lifetime}). These are given by \
\\\\citep[e.g.][]{1962AZh....39..393K}:\\n\\\\begin{align} \\n\\t\\\\left. \\\
\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}p}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\right|_\\\\mathrm{rad} &= \
-\\\\frac{4}{9} \\\\left( \\\\frac{r_0}{m_\\\\mathrm{c}c} \\\\right)^2  p^2 \
\\\\left( B(t)^2 + B_\\\\mathrm{CMB}^2 (1+z)^4 \\\\right), \
\\\\label{eq.cooling}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere  $r_0 = \
e^2/m_\\\\mathrm{e}c^2$ the classical electron radius, $B_\\\\mathrm{CMB} = \
3.2\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ the inverse Compton equivalent magnetic field \
and  $z$ the redshift of the cluster.  \\\\par\\nAnother source of systematic \
losses is due to adiabatic expansion \
\\\\citep{1962AZh....39..393K}:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\
\\mathrm{d}p}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\right|_\\\\mathrm{AE}  &= -\\\\frac{p}{3} \\\
\\frac{\\\\dot{n}_\\\\mathrm{th}(t)}{n_\\\\mathrm{th}} \\\\label{eq.AdEx}\\\\\
\\\\\\n\\\\dot{n}_\\\\mathrm{th}(t)/n_\\\\mathrm{th} &= -1/t_\\\\mathrm{exp} \
= X,\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere we have assumed that the CRe number density \
evolves like the thermal number density $n_\\\\mathrm{th}(t)$ (eq. \
\\\\ref{eq.AdExNth}).\\nFor simplicity, we assume that the shock \
instantaneously injects a power-law spectrum of CR electrons only at time \
$t=0$, i.e. the injection function in eq. \
\\\\ref{eq:cre_spectrum}:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tQ(p,t) &= n_0 p^{-s} \
\\\\delta(t), \\\\label{eq.IC}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere $n_0$ is the \
normalisation of the CRe spectrum\\\\footnote{As we have defined the spectrum \
over $p$, the unit of this normalisation is $\\\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\\\left( \\\
\\frac{\\\\mathrm{sec}}{\\\\mathrm{g cm}}\\\\right)^s $, where s is the \
spectral index. Standard formulae are usually integrated over $E = pc$ \
missing a factor of $c^{s-1}$} and $s$ is the spectral index. According to \
standard DSA the spectral index is related to the Mach number $M$ of the \
shock by \\\\citep[e.g.][]{1983RPPh...46..973D,1987PhR...154....1B}:\\n\\\\\
begin{align}\\n\\ts &= 2 \\\\frac{M^2 + 1}{M^2 - 1}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\n\\\
\\subsubsection{Solution}\\n\\nFollowing \\\\citet{1973ranp.book.....P}, \
chapter 6.3, we obtain the time-evolution of $n(p,t)$ in absence of \
additional injection, escape or any other effect except cooling and expansion \
from the sum of equations \\\\ref{eq.cooling} and \\\\ref{eq.AdEx}. This \
leads to:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tp(t) &= \\\\frac{p_0  e^{X t}}{1 + \
C_\\\\mathrm{p} \\\\beta(t) p_0}, \\\\\\\\\\n\\tC_\\\\mathrm{p} &= \\\\frac{4 \
r_0^2}{9 m_\\\\mathrm{e}^2c^2}, \\\\\\\\\\n\\t\\\\beta(t) &= \
\\\\int\\\\limits_{t_0}^t e^{X\\\\tau} \\\\left[ B^2(\\\\tau) + \
B_\\\\mathrm{IC}^2 \\\\right] \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau . \
\\\\label{eq.beta}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nHere $\\\\beta(t)$ is the \
time-integrated magnetic energy density, which parametrizes the cumulative \
effect of cooling and expansion on the spectrum. The time evolution of the CR \
electron spectrum can then be found from $n(p,t) \\\\left . \
\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}p\\\\right|_{t=0} = n(p_0,0)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}p_0 $ and the \
injection function eq. \\\\ref{eq.IC} as initial \
condition:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tn(p,t) &= n_0 p^s e^{s X t} \\\\left[ e^{X \
t} + C_\\\\mathrm{p} \\\\beta(t) p \\\\right]^{s-2} \
e^{-\\\\frac{t}{t_\\\\mathrm{exp}}}. \
\\\\label{eq.electron_spectrum}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere the last factor \
accounts for the change in volume of the gas until expansion stops, formally \
at $v_\\\\mathrm{dw} = v_\\\\mathrm{shock}$. The important quantity governing \
the cooling of the CRe population is $\\\\beta(t)$, which for a constant \
magnetic field $B(t) = B_\\\\mathrm{const}$ and no expansion \
($t_\\\\mathrm{exp} \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$) becomes: \
\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\beta_\\\\mathrm{JP}(t) &= \
\\\\left(B_\\\\mathrm{const}^2 + B_\\\\mathrm{CMB}^2(1+z)^4 \\\\right) t, \
\\\\label{eq.beta_JP}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nso equation \
\\\\ref{eq.electron_spectrum} becomes the standard Jaffe-Perola model \
\\\\citep{1973A&A....26..423J}, which leads to a cut-off when the term in \
brackets equals zero. This happens at a momentum of \
\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tp_\\\\mathrm{cut}(t) &= \
\\\\frac{m_\\\\mathrm{e}^2c^2}{C_\\\\mathrm{p}\\\\beta(t)}. \
\\\\label{eq:pcut}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nThe additional effect of adiabatic \
expansion is then to shift this spectrum to lower momenta and reduce its \
normalisation (see figure \\\\ref{fig:single_synchro_spectra}, left panel, \
red curve).\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Synchrotron Emission}\\n \\nThe synchrotron \
emissivity $j_\\\\nu$ in $\\\\mathrm{erg \\\\, cm^{-3} sec^{-1} Hz^{-1}}$  of \
an isotropic CR electron population $n(p,t) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}p$ in a \
homogeneous magnetic field $B(t)$ with pitch angle $\\\\theta$ at frequency $\
\\\\nu$ is \\\\citep{1965ARA&A...3..297G,1994hea2.book.....L}: \
\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tj_\\\\nu(t) &= \
\\\\frac{e\\\\sqrt{3}}{m_\\\\mathrm{e} c^2} \\\\int\\\\limits^{\\\\pi/2}_{0} \
B(t) \\\\sin^2\\\\theta  \\\\int n(p,t) K(x) \
\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}p\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta \\\\label{eq.synchro}\\\\\\\\ \
\\n\\tK(x) &= x \\\\int\\\\limits_x^\\\\infty K_{5/3}(z) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}z \
\\\\\\\\\\n\\tx &= \\\\frac{\\\\nu}{C_\\\\mathrm{Crit} B(t)\\\\sin{\\\\theta} \
p^2} \\\\\\\\\\n\\tC_\\\\mathrm{Crit} &= \\\\frac{3e}{4 \\\\pi \
m_\\\\mathrm{e}^3 c^3}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere $K(x)$ is the synchrotron \
kernel, $K_{5/3}$ is the Bessel function. The total synchrotron luminosity \
$L(\\\\nu)$ in erg/sec/Hz can then be found by integrating eq. \
\\\\ref{eq.synchro} over the volume of the relic. Under the assumption of \
slowly varying ICM properties and a downstream speed $v_\\\\mathrm{dw}(t)$ to \
convert distance from the shock to time:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tL(\\\\nu) &= \
 \\\\int \\\\int \\\\int j_\\\\nu(t)v_\\\\mathrm{dw}(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t \
\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}z \\\\label{eq:Inu} \\\\\\\\\\n\\t\\t   \

j_\\\\nu(t) v_\\\\mathrm{dw}(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t \
.\\\\nonumber\\n\\\\end{align}\\nFor the second equation we again used the \
parameters from section \\\\ref{sect:model}. The integrations in $t$, \
$\\\\theta$ and $p$ have to be done numerically, we use a midpoint rule for \
the former two and a Simpson rule for the latter\\\\footnote{efficient IDL \
routines are available from the authors upon request.}. \
\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Lifetimes and Basic Relic \
Physics}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}\\n\\t\\\\centering\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[\

electrons over momentum due to IC and synchrotron cooling in a constant \
magnetic field of $0.5 \\\\,\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{G}$ (dashed line), and $5 \\\\,\
\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{G}$ (full line). We over-plot 4 times the sampling momentum \
$p_\\\\mathrm{sample}$, eq. \\\\ref{eq:psample} at four frequencies: 30 GHz \
(triangles), 2.1 GHz (crosses), 610 MHz (diamonds), 150 MHz (asterisk). We \
relate the lifetime to the distance of the shock in CIZA J2242.8+5301 with a \
downstream velocity of 1000 \
km/s.}\\n\\t\\\\label{fig:lifetime}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nThe lifetime of \
CRe is defined as $t_\\\\mathrm{life} = p/\\\\dot{p}$, where $p$ is the \
momentum of a CRe and $\\\\dot{p}$ designates the systematic momentum losses \
of the CRe due to radiative and Coulomb losses (equation \\\\ref{eq.cooling} \
and \\\\citet{2014MNRAS.443.3564D}). \\\\par\\nIn figure \
\\\\ref{fig:lifetime}, we show this lifetime of CRe over momentum at cluster \
outskirts assuming magnetic fields of 5 and 0.5 $\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$, as \
full black line and dashed black line, respectively. We also show the \
lifetime in cluster centres as dot-dashed black line. We mark the smallest \
synchrotron bright momenta at 30 GHz (triangles), 2.1 GHz (crosses), 610 MHz \
(diamonds) and 150 MHz (asterisks). These momenta can be defined as: \
\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tp_\\\\mathrm{Sample} &= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\nu}{ \
C_\\\\mathrm{Crit} B(t) } } \\\\label{eq:psample}\\n\\\\end{align} \\nwhere  \
one assumes $x = 1, \\\\sin\\\\theta = 1$. The lifetime can be converted into \
a distance from the injection of CRe, using the downwind shock speed (here we \
neglect expansion of the gas). This distance is shown on the right ordinate.  \
\\\\par\\nWe see that at high observed radio frequencies, lifetimes of the \
emitting CRe are as short as a few ten Myrs (triangles), which translates to \
a few ten kpc distance from the shock. That means, the emitting region \
becomes very thin at high frequencies ($>10$ GHz). \\\\par\\nLifetimes \
increase substantially at radio frequencies below 5 GHz (crosses, diamonds, \
asterisks), resulting in a relic thickness of several 100 kpc. Because of \
high IC cooling ($B_\\\\mathrm{IC} = B_\\\\mathrm{CMB} (1+z)^2 = 4.6 \
\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ at the cluster redshift), lifetimes are not \
strongly dependent on the ambient magnetic field. Under these conditions, an \
increase in the magnetic field by a factor of ten even leads to an increase \
of lifetime of the \\\\emph{observed} CRe, because the sampling momentum \
increases as well (eq. \\\\ref{eq:psample}).  It is in general not trivial to \
assess the effect of the changing field on the total spectrum of a relic from \
the lifetime alone. However, lifetimes of CRe at a given frequency is the \
maximized, if $B = B_\\\\mathrm{IC}/\\\\sqrt{3}$ \\\\par\\nLifetimes peak \
with 1 Gyr at 300 $m_\\\\mathrm{e}\\\\mathrm{c}$ for the cluster centre \
(thermal number density $n_\\\\mathrm{th} = 10^{-3} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm}^3$) \
and 7 Gyr at 100 $m_\\\\mathrm{e}\\\\mathrm{c}$ at the location of the relic \
($n_\\\\mathrm{th} = 10^{-4} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm}^3$). Cooling is here \
dominated by Coulomb losses, hence dependent mostly on thermal density, not \
magnetic field strength \\\\citep[see][ for details]{2014MNRAS.443.3564D}. \
This means CRe can accumulate at cluster outskirts from z = 1 onwards, with \
radio galaxies as a certain source of the CR injection (see also section \
\\\\ref{sect.eff}).\\n\\n\\\\section{A Model for the Shock in CIZA \

paper, \\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V} modelled the relic with a Mach number \
of 4.6, a shock speed of 1000 km/s and a magnetic field of $5 \
\\\\mu\\\\,\\\\mathrm{G}$, using the standard formalism \\\\citep[e.g. \
][]{1998A&A...332..395E,2007MNRAS.375...77H}. \\\\citet{2011MNRAS.418..230V} \
showed a simple numerical model for the shock and constrained the merger \
scenario to two colliding clusters with a mass ratio of one to two.  The \
shock related to the northern relic was discovered in the X-rays by \
\\\\citet{2013PASJ...65...16A,2015A&A...582A..87A}, who find a Mach number of \
2.7 for the shock. \\\\citet{2013MNRAS.429.2617O} observed the cluster with \
XMM-Newton constraining the thermal ICM properties also in front of the shock \
wave. \\\\citet{2015MNRAS.450..646S,2015MNRAS.450..630S} studied the \
interaction of the shock with the star-forming galaxies in CIZA J2242.8+5301. \
\\\\citet{2014MNRAS.440.3416O} investigate the internal structure of the ICM \
and find several density discontinuities and shock candidates in the center \
of the cluster. \\\\citet{2014MNRAS.445.1213S} conducted spatially resolved \
age modelling on the relic, finding a Mach number of 2.9 and an downstream \
speed of 905 km/s from aging arguments. \\\\citet{2015ApJ...802...46J} \
constrained the Dark Matter distribution in the  merger, resulting in a total \
mass of $2 \\\\times 10^{15} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{M}_\\\\mathrm{sol}$. CIZA \
J2242.8+5301 is thereby one of the most massive clusters known to date.  \
\\\\par\\n\\nThe redshift of the cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 has been found to \
be $z\\\\approx0.19$ \\\\citep{2015ApJ...802...46J}. Observations show no \
significant difference in redshift between the two sub-clusters, hence we \
assume the cluster merger is roughly in the plane of the sky  \
\\\\citep{2015ApJ...805..143D}, see also \\\\citet{2012ApJ...756...97K}. \
\\\\par\\nWe assume the volume associated with the northern giant radio relic \
has the form of a cuboid with  a length of 2000 kpc, a cross-section area of \
$260\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc} \\\\times 260\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc}$ and a distance \
from the centre of the cluster of 1500 kpc \\\\citep{2010Sci...330..347V}. We \
assume a shock with a homogeneous Mach number $M$ of 4.6, this results in a \
compression ratio of $\\\\sigma=3.5$.  We neglect projection effects, \
\\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V} showed that the relic extends less than 10 \
degrees into the plane of the sky \\\\citep[see also][]{2012ApJ...756...97K}. \
We discuss this in section \\\\ref{sect:discussion}. \\n\\nWe note that the \
Mach number assumed here is inconsistent with Mach numbers inferred from \
X-ray observations. However, we anticipate that shocks with Mach numbers $M \
\\\\le 4$ will not reproduce the observed spectral index profile of the \
relic, which require a downstream velocity of $v_\\\\mathrm{dw} \\\\ge 1200\\\
\\,\\\\mathrm{km}/\\\\mathrm{s}$ (see \\\\citet{2014MNRAS.445.1213S} and \
section \\\\ref{sect.spix}). A discussion of our models with a Mach number of \
3 can be found in appendix \\\\ref{app.Mach}. This problem of inconsistency \
between the Mach numbers measured in the X-rays and those derived from radio \
observations of relics (assuming DSA) is well known \
\\\\citep{2015A&A...582A..87A,2014IJMPD..2330007B}. \
\\\\citet{2014ApJ...785..133H} discussed this problem using numerical \
simulations. They find that complex shocks contain a range of Mach numbers \
and radio observations are likely biased towards the highest Mach numbers in \
the distribution. \\\\par\\nWe set the upwind temperature to 3.0 keV, \
consistent with measurements from X-ray observatories, which found \
$T_\\\\mathrm{up} = 2.7^{+1.2}_{-0.7}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{keV}$ \
\\\\citep{2013PASJ...65...16A,2014MNRAS.440.3416O,2015A&A...582A..87A}. This \
leads to a downwind shock speed of 1184 km/s using the standard Mach number \
of 4.6. For this calculation we took a pre-shock density of \
$n_\\\\mathrm{th,up} = 1.6 \\\\times 10^{-4}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, which \
is based on Suzaku data (Akamatsu priv. comm.).\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Magnetic \

commonly modelled with spatially constant downstream magnetic fields, in the \
case of CIZA J2242.8+5301, \\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V} model the relic \
with $B = 5 \\\\,\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{G}$, which was subsequently used in other \
work \\\\citep{2014MNRAS.445.1213S}. We adopt this value in a model we name \
our ''standard model'', which we will show as a black line in all figures.  \
\\nAs mentioned before, a break in the total synchrotron spectrum motivates  \
that shorter lived CRe radiate in a smaller magnetic field. This can be \
realised by \\\\emph{increasing} in the magnetic field just behind the shock \
and the subsequent injection of the CR electrons. This leads to a natural \
decoupling of the region of CRe injection/acceleration (at the shock) and the \
magnetic field amplification, which is gradually amplified in the downstream \
region. We heuristically chose three functional forms for this increase, \
linear increase of magnetic energy (green in all figures, henceforth ''linear \
model''), exponential increase of the field (red in all figures, henceforth \
''exponential model'') and step function (blue in all figures, henceforth \
''step model''). The former two can be physically motivated, which we discuss \
in section \\\\ref{sect:discussion}, the step-function increase is physically \
not motivated, we chose it as an extreme case for comparison. In the linear \
and exponential case, we assume that the magnetic field reaches a maximum \
value at distance $d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$, and then declines at larger distances. \
In the exponential model, the decline is assumed to result from the adiabatic \
expansion (section \\\\ref{sect.adexp}) under the hypothesis of flux-freezing \
of the magnetic field into the thermal plasma, i.e. $B \\\\propto \
n_\\\\mathrm{th}^{2/3}$. We use an exponential decay of the density with an \
e-folding time of 240 Myrs in the exponential model (red). For the linear \
model (green), we use an exponent $\\\\delta =  -0.3$, but do not follow the \
adiabatic expansion of the gas, i.e. leave velocity and density constant. \
Then the magnetic field models take the form: \

this work} \\\\label{tab.bfldparam}\\n\\\\end{table*} \\nAn overview of the \
parameters used in this work is given in table \\\\ref{tab.bfldparam}. To fit \
the data, we empirically find a minimum magnetic field value roughly \
consistent with naive estimates at the outskirts of clusters \
$B_\\\\mathrm{min} = 0.3 \\\\,\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{G}$, and a maximum value of \
$B_\\\\mathrm{max} = 3.0 \\\\,\\\\mu \\\\mathrm{G}$, roughly consistent  with \
previous work \
\\\\citep{2010Sci...330..347V,2014MNRAS.445.1213S,2015ApJ...809..186K}. A \
best fit model is found for saturation scales $d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$ of 20, 35 \
and 50 kpc for step, exponential and linear model, respectively. An \
exploration of the parameter space of magnetic field values is given in \
appendix \\\\ref{app.parameters}, where we conclude that at high frequencies \
the radio spectrum is most sensitive to the minimum magnetic field and the \
saturation scale. \\\\par\\nWe show all four magnetic field models over time \
and distance in figure \\\\ref{fig:bfld}, where we also plot  \
$\\\\beta(t)/10^9$ as dotted lines. In our new models, the cooling is IC \
dominated, so the cooling term $\\\\beta$ is basically the same for the new \
models. Small differences arise only for  $d \\\\gg d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$.  This \
is different from the standard model, where the magnetic field about the same \
as the IC equivalent field $B_\\\\mathrm{CMB}$. Here both mechanism \
contribute to the cooling, and \\\\citet{2014MNRAS.445.1213S} showed that the \
resulting CRe cooling speed is close to its minimum with these values. \
\\\\par\\nIn our new models, the structure of the relic then motivates a \
different location of the shock, so the brightness peak of model and observed \
data coincide. In the standard model, the shock and the peak of the \
brightness profile coincide, i.e. $d_\\\\mathrm{eq} = 0$. In contrast, in the \
new models we assume that the shock is located $d_\\\\mathrm{eq} > 0$ in \
front of the brightness peak. The situation is further complicated by the \
finite resolution of the observed brightness profiles and projection effects, \
which broaden the rising flank of the emission and shift its peak, as shown \
in \\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V}.  In the standard model, the emission is \
consistent with 610 MHz data and the model in \\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V}. \
For the other models, we chose $d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$ so the model fits the \
brightness peak, without considering projection effects. Simulations are \
required to further study the shock geometry, projection effects and \
constrain this aspect of the model.  \\n\\nTo ease computation, we assume \
instantaneous injection of the CR electrons in all models. \

as purple line. \
}\\n\\t\\\\label{fig:single_synchro_spectra}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nWe begin \
by demonstrating the action of cooling and synchrotron sampling in the \
formalism. In figure \\\\ref{fig:single_synchro_spectra} left, we show the \
time evolution of $n(p,t)$ from equation \\\\ref{eq.electron_spectrum}, for \
three magnetic field models at 7 times (0, 2.41, 5.84, 14.1, 34.1, 82.7, 200 \
Myr) in cgs units. We do not show the step model, because it is not very \
instructive. We over-plot the age of the spectrum above the break momentum of \
the standard JP model with $5 \\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ (black). The other \
two models (standard color scheme) show a delayed break in the spectrum, \
because the magnetic field contributes less to the cooling in the beginning, \
i.e. the cooling is completely IC dominated. The exponential model shows a \
shift in amplitude at late times, due to the expansion of the thermal plasma. \
This uniformity in cooling is a result of the high IC equivalent magnetic \
field of $B_\\\\mathrm{IC} = 4.6 \\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$.\\\\par\\nIn \
figure \\\\ref{fig:single_synchro_spectra}, right, we compare synchrotron \
spectra at 8, 26 and 83 Myr for the standard (black) and exponential model \
(red) from equation \\\\ref{eq.synchro}. We add the emission from the \
injection, which is calculated fully analytically from the standard formulae \
in purple for both models. In contrast to the CRe spectra, the associated \
synchrotron spectrum of the exponential model increases in brightness by \
nearly a factor of ten. This is despite the expansion and due to the \
increasing magnetic field, which also leads to changes in sampling momenta \
(compare eq. \\\\ref{eq:psample}).  \\n\\n\\\\subsection{Integrated \
Synchrotron Spectra} \

\\\\citet{2016MNRAS.455.2402S} as black diamonds with error bars, and the \

\\\\ref{tab.sausage} for all four models. We chose a normalisation $n_0$ of \
the CRe spectrum equation \\\\ref{eq:cre_spectrum}, so the total flux from \
the model roughly fits the observed spectrum around 1 GHz. The normalisation \
values are reported for all four models in table \\\\ref{tab:cre_norm} \
\\\\par\\nThe resulting integrated radio synchrotron spectra over frequency \
are shown in figure \\\\ref{fig:total_synchro_spectrum}. We mark the standard \
model as solid black line, the new model in the usual color scheme. We add \
the injection spectrum of the standard model and the cooled JP spectrum of \
the standard model as black dashed line and dotted line, respectively. Recent \
observations of the large relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301 by \
\\\\citet{2016MNRAS.455.2402S} are added as black diamonds with error bars, \
where we convert the observed to rest frame frequencies by multiplying by \
$1+z$ for all frequencies. We also show the modification of the standard \
model by the SZ-decrement as dot-dashed black line, following  \
\\\\citet{2013A&A...558A..52B}, eq. 1, assuming constant thermal pressure in \
the relic from the values shown in table \\\\ref{tab.sausage} and considering \
a 150 kpc region behind the shock, consistent with the beam size at 30 GHz \
(see fig. \\\\ref{fig:conv_brightness_profiles}). \\\\par\\nAs expected, the \
standard model shows curvature only at low frequencies and does not reproduce \
the steepening at the highest frequencies. Our new models are generally \
curved outside the frequency range of 610 to 2 GHz. In particular, they show \
a steepening at high frequencies. The exponential model is here roughly \
consistent with the observations of the relic. At intermediate frequencies, \
all models reproduce the power-law behaviour expected from the standard \
JP-model. At low frequencies all models flatten and the exponential and \
linear model are roughly consistent with the data. For our thermal model and \
a volume of 2 Mpc x 150 kpc x 260 kpc, the SZ-decrement does not play a role \
at 30 GHz.  \\n\\n\\\\subsection{Normalized Brightness Profiles} \

more detailed comparison with the observed data, we now consider the radio \
brightness profiles of the relic. \\nWe obtain brightness profiles using the \
data available on the `Sausage' relic, which were previously described in \
\\\\citet[][]{2013A&A...555A.110S,2014MNRAS.441L..41S,2016MNRAS.455.2402S}. \
We produce images using all the visibilities, using a uniform weighting to \
maximise the resolution. To increase signal to noise, we average along the \
relic, using circular caps aligned with the shock structure. This was done in \
a similar fashion to Figure 20 from \\\\citet{2013A&A...555A.110S}. This \
average profile describes an average cut through the relic tracing the \
upstream, shock and downstream region. We note that the relic is, as \
expected, not perfectly traced by a circle, so a small amount of averaging \
across its width will happen.  We calculate the error at each position within \
the average profile as the error obtained by averaging over \
$N_\\\\mathrm{beams}$ number of beams, each with noise \
$\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{RMS}$:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tE_\\\\mathrm{profile} &= \
\\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\Sigma^{N_\\\\mathrm{beams}}_1 \

figure \\\\ref{fig:conv_brightness_profiles}, we show the observed radio \
profiles from \\\\citet{2016MNRAS.455.2402S} at eight observed frequencies, \
top left to bottom right: 50, 153, 323, 608, 1382, 2274, 16000, 30000 MHz. We \
convert the frequencies to the intrinsic frequencies at redshift $z = 0.19$: \
59.50, 182, 384.3, 723.5, 1644, 2703, 19040, 35700 MHz. The standard model is \
shown as black line and our new models in the usual colors. We add the model \
profiles, convolved with the appropriate beam from the observations. We note \
that for the new models, the shock is located at a distance of 0 kpc. In \
contrast, for the standard model, the shock is located at 30 kpc. \
\\\\par\\nWe find a reasonable fit of the exponential model and linear model \
at all frequencies.  The standard and step model  predict excess emission at \
low frequencies and large distances. The linear model predicts a significant \
shift in the position of the brightness relic at the highest frequencies \
compared to the lower frequencies.  We note that \
\\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V} showed that a broadening at the rising flank \
of the profile is consistent with projection effects into the plane of the \
sky.  All but the exponential model exhibit excess emission at the lowest \
frequencies, indicating the best fit of an exponential decay of the magnetic \
field after the brightness peak. We conclude that the exponential and linear \
model are roughly consistent with the data, if the relic extends into the \
plane of the sky with an angle $\\\\Psi < 10\\\\deg$.  \

1200 km/s. For comparison we show the standard model with 1000 km/s as a \

\\\\citep{2016MNRAS.455.2402S} and from the standard model (black line) and \
our three new models in the usual colors. We add the standard model with a \
downwind speed of 1000 km/s as a dashed black line. The error bars on the \
data include a $10\\\\%$ error in flux scale. We convolve our models with a \
beam of  16 arcsec. We mark the flattest spectral index expected from simple \
DSA (-0.5) as a dotted horizontal line.   \\\\par\\nOur models are well \
consistent with the data. The standard model with 1000 km/s downwind speed is \
not consistent with the data. We note that because the spectral index \
profiles are obtained only from two frequencies, they are very sensitive to \
errors in the flux scale and fluctuations/noise present in only one \
frequency.\\n\\nFor magnetic fields smaller than $B_\\\\mathrm{IC}$ (IC \
dominated cooling), the shape of the spectral index profile primarily \
measures the downwind speed $v_\\\\mathrm{dw}$. Decreasing this quantity will \
lead to a steepening in the spectral index profile. In our model, the \
spectral index profile strongly disfavours a downwind speed of less than 1000 \
km/s (black dashed line). This is consistent with models shown in \
\\\\citet{2014MNRAS.445.1213S}, who conclude that the aging requires downwind \
speeds not smaller than 1200 km/s. In the absence of additional physics, \
recent measurements for the upstream temperature in the cluster disfavour a \
scenario with Mach numbers below 4: E.g. a Mach number of 3.5 would require \
an upstream temperature above 4 keV to lead to a downwind speed of 1200 km/s. \
This temperature is then not consistent with recent X-ray observations that \
measure 8 keV downstream \\\\citep{2014MNRAS.440.3416O,2015A&A...582A..87A}. \
These problems could be alleviated by introducing CRe diffusion away from the \
shock or \\\"in situ\\\" re-acceleration downstream, this is however beyond \
the aim of our paper \\\\citep{2016arXiv160207304F}. \\\\par\\nAt the same \
time, however, we note that if we assume the geometry of our (exponential) \
model, the temperature and density jump that are derived from X-ray \
observations are likely biased low, due to the expansion downstream, leading \
to a possible underestimation of the Mach number. Indeed, the downstream \
temperature of 8 keV has been measured by \\\\citet{2015A&A...582A..87A} \
using an extraction region of the order of Mpc. According to the parameters \
that we have to assume in order to fit the radio properties of the relic, \
namely the e-folding time $\\\\approx 240 Myr$, the downstream temperature is \
expected to decline from 15 to about 8 keV in about 100-150 kpc. \
\\n\\n\\\\section{Discussion} \\\\label{sect:discussion}\\n\\nWe find that \
the total integrated synchrotron spectrum is best fit by an \
\\\\emph{exponential} increase in the magnetic field by a factor of 5-10 on a \
scale of $d_\\\\mathrm{eq} = 40\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc}$ in front of the \
brightness peak of the relic at 2.1 GHz. This assumes a maximum thickness \
into the plane of the sky of $< 260 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc}$, consistent with \
previous models. The exponential model is also roughly consistent with the \
brightness profiles and the spectral index profile. \\\\par\\nThe simple \
relic model, based on a constant magnetic field and diffusive shock \
acceleration (DSA) from the thermal pool, are ruled out given the observed \
spectrum and brightness profiles for our set of parameters. The linear model \
does not fit the data as well as the exponential model. \\\\par \\n\\nThe \
magnetic field strengths proposed here are roughly within theoretical \
expectations given the distance from the cluster centre: Faraday rotation \
measurements in clusters as well as cosmological MHD simulations find small \
fields at cluster outskirts. A correlation of the ICM magnetic field with the \
ICM thermal density $n_\\\\mathrm{th}$ exists \
\\\\citep{2001A&A...378..777D,2009MNRAS.392.1008D}:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tB(\
r) &\\\\propto  n_\\\\mathrm{th}^\\\\xi(r) \\\\\\\\\\n\\t\\t&= B_0 \\\\left(1 \
+ \\\\frac{r^2}{r_\\\\mathrm{c}^2}\\\\right)^{-\\\\beta \
\\\\xi}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere it is usually assumed that $\\\\xi = 0.5$ or \
$\\\\xi = 1$. Here $r$ is the radius from the cluster centre. For the \
standard $\\\\beta$-model inferred from X-ray observations of clusters and \
magnetic field normalisation found in the Coma cluster \
\\\\citep{2010A&A...513A..30B}, this motivates magnetic fields at the \
outskirts of the cluster ($d_\\\\mathrm{center} = 1.5\\\\, \\\\mathrm{Mpc}$) \
of $0.1 - 1.2 \\\\mu \\\\mathrm{G}$. The amplification factor assuming a \
shock with Mach number 4.6 is $< 3.5$ (3.5 for purely perpendicular shocks \
where the upstream field is perpendicular to the shock normal, and about 2.3 \
considering isotropic compression). This means that additional mechanisms are \
necessary to explain the increase of the magnetic field downstream that is  \
required in our model to match radio data.\\n\\n \\n\\\\subsection{Magnetic \
Field Increase}\\n\\nIn our new models, we assume an amplification of the \
magnetic field by a factor of 5-10 behind the shock on a length scale of \
roughly $d_\\\\mathrm{eq} \\\\approx 40$ kpc. Unfortunately, the \
amplification of magnetic fields behind shocks in the ICM is not well \
understood. This limits us to the following simple energy arguments. \
\\\\par\\nWe can compare the energy flux of the shock to the magnetic energy \
flux required for the amplification. Following  \
\\\\citet{2010ApJ...715.1143F}, the energy flux available at the shock is \
given by: \\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tF_\\\\mathrm{shock} &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \
\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{up} v_\\\\mathrm{shock}^3 \\\\left(1 - \
\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)\\\\label{eq.Ediss} \\\\\\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\
\\t &= 1 \\\\times 10^{-2} \\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{erg}}{\\\\mathrm{cm}^2 \\\
\\mathrm{sec}},\\\\nonumber\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere $\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{up} \
= 3.04\\\\times 10^{-28} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{g}/\\\\mathrm{cm}^3$ is the upstream \
density and $v_\\\\mathrm{shock} = 4149 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{km}/\\\\mathrm{s}$ is \
the shock speed in the upstream medium. The increase in magnetic energy in \
the exponential model results in an approximate increase in magnetic energy \
flux:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tF_\\\\mathrm{mag} &\\\\approx \
v_\\\\mathrm{dw}(0) \\\\left(B_\\\\mathrm{max}^2 - \
B_\\\\mathrm{min}^2\\\\right)/8\\\\pi  \\\\\\\\\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t&= \
4.2\\\\times10^{-5} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{erg}/\\\\mathrm{cm^2 sec}, \
\\\\nonumber\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhich is a factor 20 below the shock energy \
flux. Hence, in principle the field amplification is energetically possible. \
\\\\par\\nIf we for the moment assume the magnetic field increase is due to \
solenoidal turbulence and an MHD dynamo, we can derive combined constrains on \
the turbulent injection scale $l_0$, the dynamo efficiency \
$\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{B}$  and the magnetic field increase $\\\\Delta B^2 = \
B_\\\\mathrm{max}^2 - B_\\\\mathrm{min}^2$. The energy flux into turbulence \
is then:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{t} \\\\frac{1}{2} \
\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{up} v_\\\\mathrm{up}^3 \\\\left( 1 - \
\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right) &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{dw} \
v_\\\\mathrm{dw} V_0^2, \\\\label{eq:cascade}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere $V_0$ \
is the turbulent velocity at injection scale $k_0$. If we assume \
$\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{t} = 0.05$ is the fraction of energy flux available at \
the shock that is converted into turbulence downstream:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\
\\tV_0 &= \\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{t}^{1/2} v_\\\\mathrm{up} \\\\left( 1- \
\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\label{eq.v0} \\\\\\\\\\n\\t\\t&\
\\\\approx 890 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{km}/\\\\mathrm{s}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\eta_\\\
\\mathrm{t}}{0.05} \\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\nonumber\\n\\\\end{align}\\nWith the \
Alven speed $v_\\\\mathrm{A} = \\\\Delta B / \
\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{dw}} \\\\approx 200 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{km}/\\\
\\mathrm{s}$, we obtain the Alvenic Mach number $M_\\\\mathrm{A} = V_0 \
/V_\\\\mathrm{A}$:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tM_\\\\mathrm{A} &\\\\approx 2.9 \\\
\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{t}}{0.05}\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\left( \
\\\\frac{\\\\Delta B}{3 \\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}} \
\\\\right)^{-1}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nHence turbulence is super-Alfvenic at the \
shock and then gradually becomes quasi-Alfvenic with distance. For solenoidal \
turbulence, the energy flux transported by the turbulent cascade to smaller \
scales is given by:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\Phi_\\\\mathrm{casc} \
&\\\\approx \\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{dw} V_0^3 k_0.\\n\\\\end{align}\\nA fraction \
of this flux, $\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{B}$, can be converted into magnetic field \
amplification through turbulent \
dynamo:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}E_\\\\mathrm{B}}{\\\\\
mathrm{d}t} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\Delta B^2}{8\\\\pi\\\\Delta t} &= \
\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{B}  \\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{dw}V_0^3 k_0. \
\\\\label{eq:dynamo}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nIf we assume that \
$\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{B} = 0.05$ of the turbulent energy is converted into \
magnetic energy, combining eq. \\\\ref{eq:dynamo} and \\\\ref{eq.v0} leads to \
an injection scale $l_0$ of: \\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\tk_0^{-1} \\\\propto l_0 \
&= \\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\eta_{t}^{3/2} \\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{dw} \
v_\\\\mathrm{up}^3 \\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right)^{3/2} \
\\\\frac{8\\\\pi\\\\Delta t}{\\\\Delta B^2} \\\\label{eq.l0}\\\\\\\\\\n\\t&\\\
\\approx 5 \\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\eta_b}{0.05}\\\\right) \
\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{t}}{0.05}\\\\right)^{3/2} \\\\left[ \
\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta B}{3\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}} \
\\\\right)^2/\\\\Delta t_\\\\mathrm{eq}\\\\right]^{-1}, \
\\\\nonumber\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhich is a reasonable value. Here $\\\\Delta \
t_{eq} = d_\\\\mathrm{eq}/v_\\\\mathrm{dw}(0)$. In order to achieve efficient \
amplification we require that turbulent motions reach the MHD scale, \
$l_\\\\mathrm{A} = l_0 M_\\\\mathrm{A}^{-3}$, where $M_\\\\mathrm{A}$ is the \
Alfvenic Mach number, i.e. the turbulent cascading time scale, $\\\\sim \
l_0/V_0$, should be smaller than the crossing time-scale, \
$d_\\\\mathrm{eq}/V_\\\\mathrm{dw}$. This requires $ \\\\frac{l_0}{V_0} \
\\\\le \\\\Delta t_{eq}$, implying (eq. \\\\ref{eq.v0} and \
\\\\ref{eq.l0}):\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\frac{\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{t}}{0.05}\
 &\\\\le 3.5 \
\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{B}}{0.05}\\\\right)^{-1}.\\n\\\\end{\
align}\\nThis provides a condition between turbulent efficiency and dynamo \
that is satisfied under our assumptions. As soon as the energy density of \
magnetic fields reaches a substantial fraction of the energy associated with \
turbulent motions (i.e. for $M_A$ reaching unity) magnetic field tension \
prevents turbulent motions and the amplification process slows down. In our \
scenario this situation would be realised at distance $\\\\sim \
d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$, at these distances magnetic field energy density saturates \
and the field strength starts declining due to adiabatic expansion. Above \
estimates demonstrate that the magnetic field luminosity required by the \
model is not in conflict with basic energy constraints, turbulent scales and \
relevant time-scales. \\\\par \\nAn interesting outcome of this scenario is \
that during the initial phases of amplification the magnetic field topology \
is highly turbulent, the Alfvenic Mach number being very large.\\\\par\\nThis \
implies that the synchrotron emission at higher frequencies is not expected \
to be strongly polarised. On the contrary, stronger polarization is expected \
when the magnetic field reaches quasi-equipartition, at scales $\\\\approx d_\
\\\\mathrm{eq}$, where the bulk of the emission at lower (GHz) frequencies is \
produced in a strong field that is advected and possibly stirred downstream. \
Hence in our model, intrinsic polarisation in the relic depends on distance \
from the shock and frequency. This prediction can be tested with modern radio \
interferometers.\\n\\n  \\n\\\\subsection{Magnetic Field Decrease}\\n\\nThe \
magnetic field decrease is constrained by the decline in brightness behind \
the peak of the emission in the relic. The effect of the magnetic field \
itself on the CRe cooling is rather small, hence the field is constrained \
well, especially at low frequencies, where CRe cool slowly. \\\\par\\nSeveral \
mechanisms may contribute to this decline, dissipation of turbulent motions, \
magnetic reconnection or adiabatic expansion. We limit our considerations \
here to the latter, because it is physically unavoidable and easy to model. \
\\\\par\\nOur best-fit exponential model self-consistently includes adiabatic \
expansion along the shock normal. This result suggests that expansion indeed \
plays an important role in shaping the relic emission. The linear model \
reproduces the brightness profiles nearly as well, however with more \
dissipation of magnetic energy.  The data at 150 MHz rule out the standard \
model with constant density and a constant magnetic field of $5 \\\\,\\\\mu\\\
\\mathrm{G}$. \\n\\n\\\\section{Acceleration Efficiency in the Northern Relic \

Re-acceleration}\\n\\nAdiabatic compression of a pre-existing CRe population \
can possibly solve the efficiency problems encountered in recent models for \
relics \\\\citep[][]{2015ApJ...809..186K}. Here we derive constrains on the \
energy density of pre-existing CRes before the shock in the northern relic of \
CIZA J2242.8+5301. \\\\par\\nIn DSA simulations, the efficiency for CRe \
injection $\\\\eta_\\\\mathrm{KR}$ in the frame of the upstream medium is \
defined as \\\\citep{2013ApJ...764...95K}:\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\t\\\\eta_\\\
\\mathrm{KR}(M) &= \\\\frac{2 \
v_\\\\mathrm{dw}}{\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{up}v_\\\\mathrm{shock}^3} \\\\left[ \

\\\\label{eq.eta_KR}\\n\\\\end{align}\\nwhere $\\\\gamma_\\\\mathrm{CR} = \
4/3$ is the adiabatic index of CRe and $\\\\epsilon_\\\\mathrm{CRe,up}$ and $\
\\\\epsilon_\\\\mathrm{CRe,dw}$ are the upstream and downstream CRe energy \
densities, respectively.  \

}\\n\\t\\\\label{fig:eta_eps}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nIn figure \
\\\\ref{fig:eta_eps} we show the required acceleration efficiency $\\\\eta_\\\
\\mathrm{KR}(M)$ over the energy density in CRe ahead of the shock \
$\\\\epsilon_\\\\mathrm{CRe,up}$ for the relic. We plot the upstream CRe \
energy density in units of the upstream thermal energy density. For energy \
densities of 0.1 percent the required efficiency drops very quickly for all \
models, because of adiabatic gains in energy. This compression sets an upper \
limit on the pre-existing CRe energy density before the shock, less than one \
percent of the upstream thermal energy density all models. \\\\par\\nThis \
demonstrates that compression can reduce the required energy flux and solve \
the acceleration efficiency problem, even if only very moderate amounts of \
CRe are present in front of the shock \\\\citep{2015ApJ...809..186K}. As \
shown in section \\\\ref{sect:lifetimes}, CRe lifetimes at the location of \
the relic are around half a Hubble time, thus a radio dark population of CRe \
can accumulate in the outskirts of a cluster during its formation from z = 1. \
This pre-existing population of CRe is likely to have low momenta between 10 \
and 100 $\\\\mathrm{m}_\\\\mathrm{e}\\\\mathrm{c}$, because at these momenta \
the lifetime shown in figure \\\\ref{fig:lifetime} peaks. For the reasonable \
assumption of turbulent diffusion of CRe, this also means large diffusion \
lengths in the Mpc regime and smooth spatial distributions of the population. \
\\\\par\\nThis scenario differs from the scenario of localized ''CRe clouds'' \
deposited by radio galaxies and re-accelerated by shocks to form relics \
\\\\citep[e.g.][]{2015ApJ...809..186K,2016arXiv160203278K}. The two scenarios \
could explain the morphological differences between the northern and the \
southern relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301: The northern source population of CRe \
was accumulated over Gyrs and hence is smooth and leads to the observed \
regular relic morphology, while the southern source population is younger and \
originates from outflows of nearby radio galaxies. \\\\par\\nIn the centre of \
clusters, lifetimes less than one Gyr imply that quiet or cool core clusters \
can in principle be rather depleted of CRe even at these low energies, \
potentially making relic formation from an old population more \
difficult.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Comparison to Previous Models} \

GHz, while \\\\citet{2014MNRAS.445.1213S} model is too steep and does not fit \
the data at 150 and 320 MHz, probably because we left $n_0$ constant \
downstream. See also appendix \
\\\\ref{app.Mach}.\\\\par\\n\\n\\\\section{Conclusions}\\\\label{sect.\
conlusions}\\n\\nWe have proposed to attribute the spectral steepening in \
radio relics to higher energy cosmic-ray electrons preferentially emitting in \
lower magnetic fields than the bulk of the CRe. We then presented a first \
model for a radio relic considering time dependent magnetic fields and \
adiabatic expansion of the thermal plasma behind the shock. Our model \
requires a gradual amplification of the magnetic field in a small region \
downstream of the shock and exceeds expected field strengths at the shock due \
to compression.  \\\\par\\nWe focused our efforts on the prototype of radio \
relics, the ''Sausage'' relic in CIZA J2242.8+5301. We developed the \
formalism to obtain cooling CRe spectra and synchrotron spectra for such \
models. Considering standard parameters for the northern shock in CIZA \
J2242.8+5301, we find that\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\t\\\\item the standard \
model of the relic using a constant magnetic field of \
$5\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ is inconsistent with the observed brightness \
profile at 150 MHz. The standard downstream speed of 1000 km/s is \
inconsistent with the spectral index profiles between 150 and 610 MHz. The \
profiles support a downstream speed of 1200 km/s.\\n\\t\\\\item Behind the \
brightness peak, we find a best fit model where the magnetic field declines \
exponentially alongside adiabatic expansion of the gas with an e-fold \
distance of 240 kpc.\\n\\t\\\\item the observed radio synchrotron spectrum \
and the brightness profiles are consistent with a shock Mach number of 4.6 \
and an exponentially increasing magnetic field from 0.3 to 3.0 \
$\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ in the 40 kpc before the brightness peak.  The model \
predicts a shift in the brightness peak of the relic observing frequencies \
above 16 GHz. It also predicts that intrinsic polarised intensity depends on \
the distance from the shock and on observing frequency, which can be used to \
falsify the model observationally. \\n\\t\\\\item an interpretation of the \
increase as a turbulent dynamo, caused by a short burst of turbulence, yields \
an injection scale of about 10 kpc, if 5 \\\\% of the shock energy is \
converted into turbulence and 5\\\\% of the turbulent energy drives the \
dynamo. We have also shown that the picture does not appear inconsistent with \
relevant quantities and time-scales.\\n\\t\\\\item relatively large \
acceleration efficiencies are required by our model provided that electrons \
are accelerated from the thermal pool.  However, plausible energy densities \
($<1\\\\%$) of pre-existing CRe before the shock can at least reduce the \
required efficiency, due to adiabatic compression by the shock. We find such \
a scenario well motivated: The expected lifetime of CRe  in the cluster \
outskirts is very long: $\\\\approx 7\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Gyrs}$ at $100 \
\\\\,\\\\mathrm{m}_\\\\mathrm{e}\\\\mathrm{c}$. Hence, CRe are able to \
accumulate  over the lifetime of the cluster in its outskirts as well.  \\n\\\

MHz), corresponding to observed frequencies: 50, 153, 323, 608, 1382, 2272, \
16000, 30000 MHz. The standard model is shown in black with grey errors, the \
step function model in blue, the exponential model in red and the linear \
model in green. In the third graph at 723.5 MHz we add the exponential model \
convolved with a 12 kpc beam as red dashed line. Black diamonds are \
deconvolved WSRT observations from \\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V}.  }\\n\\t\\\
\\label{fig:brightness_profiles}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nFor completeness, we \
report here the brightness profiles reported in figure \
\\\\ref{fig:conv_brightness_profiles} without convolving with the observed \
beam. In figure \\\\ref{fig:brightness_profiles}, we show these predicted \
relic brightness in arbitrary units over distance.\\n In the third panel we \
also show the deconvolved profile observed at 610 MHz from \
\\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V} as black diamonds. In that panel we also plot \
the exponential model convolved with a Gaussian with FWHM of 12 kpc.  We find \
a reasonable match to the deconvolved observed profile at 610 MHz, especially \
considering that the deconvolution is probably not perfect. At frequencies \
above 2 GHz the predicted relic emission becomes only a few ten kpc wide. \
Additionally, the linear model predicts a shift in the brightness peak at \
these frequencies compared to frequencies below 2 GHz. This motivates high \
resolution observations of the Sausage or similar relics to observe the shift \
in the brightness profile. \\n\\n\\\\section{A Model with Lower Mach Number} \

at 150 MHz and 610 MHz, and spectral index profile between 150 MHz and 610 \
MHz, for a Mach number of three. All panels are analogous to the same figures \
show previously.} \\n\\t\\\\label{fig:app_M=3}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nIn \
section we show results from a model with Mach number of $M=3$. This is \
motivated by X-ray observations, which suggest a shock weaker than that \
adopted in our paper, specifically $M \\\\leq 3$ \
\\\\citep[e.g.][]{2015A&A...582A..87A}.\\\\par\\nThe normalisations ($n_0$) \
used in this model are  $5.4\\\\times 10^{-4}$, $16\\\\times 10^{-4}$, $160\\\
\\times 10^{-4}$ and $18\\\\times 10^{-4}$ in the same units\\\\footnote{Note \
that the energy densities associated with these normalisations are larger \
than for the $M=4.6$ model, because of the change in spectral index.} as in \
table \\\\ref{tab:cre_norm}, for the standard, step, exponential and linear \
energy model, respectively.   \\\\par\\nIn figure \\\\ref{fig:app_M=3}, we \
show the integrated radio spectrum, the convolved brightness profile at 150 \
MHz and 610 MHz and the spectral index profile of the models using a Mach \
number of $M=3$, from top left to bottom right. We employ a magnetic field \
minimum of $0.3 \\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ and a maximum of $3 \
\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$. We require saturation scales of 15, 19, 37 and 52 \
kpc for the four models, respectively. The values for the field and the \
saturation scale are partially degenerate, as shown in appendix \
\\\\ref{app.parameters}. Hence, a lower $B_\\\\mathrm{min}$ does not lead to \
a better overall fit of the model. \\\\par\\nThe total integrated radio \
spectrum is fit well above 1 GHz by all but the standard model. However, all \
models are inconsistent with the observed radio spectrum at low frequencies. \
For the exponential model we used an e-folding distance of the adiabatic \
expansion of 80 kpc. We refrain from lowering this parameter even further to \
ensure $d_\\\\mathrm{eq} \\\\ll t_\\\\mathrm{exp}v_\\\\mathrm{dw}$ \
\\\\par\\nThe convolved brightness profile at 150 MHz and 610 MHz is compared \
with model predictions in the top right and bottom left panels. The \
exponential model declines too quickly due to the combined effect of \
adiabatic expansion and small downstream velocity. It also shows a \
significant shift in the brightness peak, not consistent with the \
observations.\\\\par\\nFinally the comparison with the spectral index profile \
is very instructive. All models show a steepening of the spectrum with \
distance that is stronger than the observed one. The steepening with distance \
constrains the velocity of the flow downstream, which is only 900 km/s  for a \
Mach number of $M = 3$. As we explained in sect. \\\\ref{sect.spix} a minimum \
downstream velocity of $v_\\\\mathrm{dw}= 1200 \
\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km}/\\\\mathrm{s}$ is required to explain observations. \
\\\\par\\nWe conclude that a model with a Mach number of three is disfavoured \
by radio observations, unless additional mechanisms that maintain CR \
electrons at higher energies for longer times (e.g. re-acceleration) or that \
enhance the spatial transport of high energy electrons (e.g. diffusion) are \
considered.\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Dependence on Model \
Parameters}\\\\label{app.parameters}\\n\\nIn this section, we explore the \
parameter space of the exponential model, to show the importance of the \
individual input parameters. These are :\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\t\\\\item \
the minimum magnetic field value: $B_\\\\mathrm{min}$,\\n\\t\\\\item the \
maximum magnetic field value: $B_\\\\mathrm{max}$,\\n\\t\\\\item the \
saturation distance: $d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$,\\n\\t\\\\item the shock speed: $v_\\\
\\mathrm{dw}$.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nWe conclude that the e-fold distance \
is degenerate with the downwind speed. Hence, given a shock speed, the e-fold \
distance can always be found so the model brightness profiles fit the \
observed profiles. We keep the Mach number fixed at 4.6, a model with $M=3$ \
was considered above. \\\\par\\nIn what follows, we present the total \
integrated synchrotron spectrum and the two brightness profiles at 150 MHz \
and 610 MHz varying one parameter, while leaving the other three fixed. The \
exponential model with standard values is always shown in black, the lower  \
value in green and the upper value in blue.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Minimum \
Magnetic Field \
Value}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}\\n\\t\\\\centering\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[\

MHz and integrated synchrotron spectrum (top left to bottom right) for the \
exponential model with minimum magnetic field $B_\\\\mathrm{min}$ equal to \
$0.3\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ (standard model, black), \
$0.15\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ (green) and $0.6\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ \
(blue).} \\n\\t\\\\label{fig:app_var_bmin}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nWe first \
consider the minimum magnetic field strength in the exponential model. For \
the three values of $B_\\\\mathrm{min}$, 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 \
$\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ we show brightness profiles at two frequencies and the \
total synchrotron spectrum in figure \\\\ref{fig:app_var_bmin}. This \
parameter has two effects on the observables: An increase in \
$B_\\\\mathrm{min}$ increases the brightness at the rising flank of the \
profile, most significantly at low frequencies. It also decreases the \
steepening of the spectrum at high radio frequencies. Given the magnetic \
field values expected at the location of the relic, smaller values than $0.1 \
\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ are  difficult to justify behind the shock. \
\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Maximum Magnetic Field Value}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}\\n\
\\t\\\\centering\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\\\textwidth]{img/\
brightness_profile_Bmax_150.pdf} \
\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\\\textwidth]{img/brightness_profile_\

\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\\\textwidth]{img/radio_spectrum_Bmax.\
pdf}\\n\\t\\\\caption{Beam convolved brightness profiles at 150 MHz and 610 \
MHz and integrated synchrotron spectrum (top left to bottom right) for the \
exponential model with minimum magnetic field $B_\\\\mathrm{max}$ equal to $3\

$2\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ (green) and $6\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ \
(blue).}\\n\\t\\\\label{fig:app_var_bmax}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nNext we \
vary the maximum magnetic field strength $B_\\\\mathrm{max}$, which is $3 \
\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ in the standard model (black), to \
$2\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ (green) and $6\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\mathrm{G}$ (blue). \
The lower limit is here set by the inverse Compton limit, the higher value is \
consistent with the standard model from \\\\citet{2010Sci...330..347V}. \
\\\\par\\nThe resulting brightness profiles and radio synchrotron spectrum \
are shown in figure \\\\ref{fig:app_var_bmax}. The major impact of the \
parameter is visible in the normalisation of the radio synchrotron spectrum, \
where the low and high models show a shift in the model spectrum. This would \
reduce (increase) the CRe normalisation and required acceleration \
efficiencies.The changes to the brightness profiles are minor and roughly \
within the error bars of the observations. We conclude that the maximum \
magnetic field strength mostly affects the normalisation of the CRe spectrum \
and has only minor influence on the brightness \
profile.\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Saturation \
Distance}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}\\n\\t\\\\centering\\n\\t\\\\\
includegraphics[width=0.33\\\\textwidth]{img/brightness_profile_deq_150.pdf} \

MHz and 610 MHz and integrated synchrotron spectrum (top left to bottom \

$29\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc}$ (green) and $44\\\\,\\\\mathrm{kpc}$ \
(blue).}\\n\\t\\\\label{fig:app_var_deq}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nIn figure \\\
\\ref{fig:app_var_deq} we show brightness profiles and synchrotron spectrum, \
varying the saturation distance $d_\\\\mathrm{eq}$ by $20\\\\%$, from 37 kpc, \
to 29 kpc (green) and 44 kpc (blue). The change leads to a shift in the peak \
of the brightness profiles by roughly 10 kpc and an decrease (increase) in \
the steepening of radio spectrum and high frequencies for smaller (larger) \
saturation distances. We conclude that this parameter has a rather large \
impact on the model. In the absence of any projection effects it could be \
constrained very well by the observed high resolution brightness profiles.\\n\
\\n\\\\subsection{Downwind \
Speed}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure*}\\n\\t\\\\centering\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[\
width=0.33\\\\textwidth]{img/brightness_profile_vs_150.pdf} \
\\n\\t\\\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\\\textwidth]{img/brightness_profile_vs_\

the exponential model with downwind velocity $v_\\\\mathrm{dw}$ equal to \
$1000\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km/s}$ (standard model, black), \
$800\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km/s}$ (green) and $1200\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km/s}$ \
(blue).}\\n\\t\\\\label{fig:app_var_vs}\\n\\\\end{figure*}\\n\\nWe consider \
the downstream shock speed $v_\\\\mathrm{dw}$ as the final parameter, again \
changing it by $20\\\\%$ to 1421 km/s (blue) or 950 km/s (green). The change \
leads to a shift in the peak position of the brightness profiles to larger \
(green) or smaller (blue) distances. The change in cooling velocity also \
leads to an increase (decrease) for smaller (larger) of the spectral \
steepening, respectively. \\\\par\\n\\nWe conclude that shock speed and \
saturation distance have the largest impact on the model. The saturation \
distance can in principle be well constrained by very high resolution \
observation of the relic at intermediate frequencies. The down stream shock \
speed is highly uncertain as it depends on the Mach number, the expansion \
timescale and the upstream sound speed, which in turn depends on the upstream \
temperatures.  \
