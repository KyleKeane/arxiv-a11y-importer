n\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\\\label{sec:intro}\\n\\nQuite a number of $D$ \
meson, $D_s$ meson and charmonium states have been observed in experiments \\\
\\cite{PDG}. Several of them are both experimentally and theoretically \
well-understood, i.e.\\\\ their quantum numbers and their structure are \
known. Examples include, in particular, the pseudoscalar ground state mesons \
$D$, $D_s$ and $\\\\eta_c(1S)$ and the vector ground state mesons \
$D^\\\\ast$, $D_s^\\\\ast$ and $J/\\\\psi(1S)$. There are, however, open \
questions regarding some of the more recently found excitations. Examples are \
the positive parity mesons $D_{s0}^\\\\ast(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, first \
reported by BaBar \\\\cite{Aubert:2003fg} and CLEO \\\\cite{Besson:2003cp}, \
respectively, which are unexpectedly light compared to expectations from \
quark model calculations. This could be an indication that these states are \
not just quark-antiquark pairs, but have a more complicated structure, e.g.\\\
\\ are composed of two quarks and two antiquarks, a scenario at the moment \
neither established nor ruled out. The situation is similar for some of the \
charmonium-like $X$ states, e.g.\\\\ $X(3872)$ first observed by Belle \
\\\\cite{Choi:2003ue}.\\n\\nThere are many interesting approaches to study \
$D$ mesons, $D_s$ mesons and charmonium states theoretically, e.g.\\\\ quark \
models \\\\cite{Ebert:2009ua}, effective theories respecting QCD symmetries \
\\\\cite{Eshraim:2014eka} or Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations \
\\\\cite{Fischer:2014cfa}, to just name a few. Of course, it would be highly \
desirable to understand these mesons and their properties starting from first \
principles, i.e.\\\\ the QCD Lagrangian, without any assumptions, model \
simplifications or truncations. The corresponding method is lattice QCD, a \
numerical technique to compute QCD observables, which allows to investigate \
and quantify all sources of systematic error. Computing the spectrum and \
investigating the structure of mesons using lattice QCD is, however, a \
challenging task. Several problems have only partly been solved or require \
investing a rather large amount of high performance computing resources, for \
example simulations with physically light $u/d$ quarks. Similarly, to remove \
discretization errors, one has to study the continuum limit, which \
necessitates time consuming simulations at several different lattice \
spacings. Particularly problematic is the investigation of mesons, which \
readily decay into lighter multi-particle states. Such states should \
theoretically be treated as resonances and not as stable quark-antiquark \
states, which is technically extremely difficult, even for simple cases, \
where only a single decay channel exists. Examples are $D_0^\\\\ast(2400)$ \
and $D_1(2430)$ with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^+$ and $J^P = 1^+$. Similarly, \
it is very challenging to study mesons which might have a structure more \
complicated than a simple quark-antiquark pair, e.g.\\\\ candidates for \
tetraquarks or hybrid mesons. While there has been a lot of impressive \
progress regarding lattice QCD hadron spectroscopy within the last couple of \
years, there is certainly still a lot of room for improvement. Simple states, \
in particular pseudoscalar and vector ground state mesons, have, meanwhile, \
been studied very accurately, including simulations at or extrapolations to \
physically light $u/d$ quark masses and the continuum limit. On the other \
hand, the majority of studies concerned with parity, radial and orbital \
excitations are still at a more exploratory stage, i.e.\\\\ have quite often \
been performed at unphysically heavy quark masses or at a single finite \
lattice spacing. Recent reviews discussing the status of lattice QCD \
computations of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons and of charmonium are Refs.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Mohler:2015zsa} and \\\\cite{DeTar:2011nn,Prelovsek:2015fra}, \
respectively.\\n\\nThe most common approach to compute meson masses using \
lattice QCD is to employ meson creation operators, which are composed of a \
quark and an antiquark, and to extract meson masses from the exponential \
decay of corresponding correlation functions\\\\footnote{For a basic \
introduction to lattice hadron spectroscopy, cf.\\\\ Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Weber:2013eba}.}. This strategy yields accurate and solid results \
for mesons which resemble quark-antiquark pairs and which are quite stable, \
i.e.\\\\ many of the low-lying states in the $D$ meson, $D_s$ meson and \
charmonium sector. Recent lattice QCD papers following this strategy to \
compute masses and spectra of $D$ and $D_s$ mesons and of charmonium are \
Refs.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Dudek:2007wv,Dong:2009wk,Burch:2009az,Dudek:2010wm,Mohler:2011ke,\
Namekawa:2011wt,\\nBali:2011dc,Bali:2011rd,Liu:2012ze,Yang:2012mya,Dowdall:\
2012ab,Bali:2012ua,\\nMoir:2013ub,Galloway:2014tta,Bali:2015lka}. Rigorous \
treatments of more complicated mesonic systems like the previously mentioned \
unstable $D_0^\\\\ast(2400)$ and $D_1(2430)$ mesons or the tetraquark \
candidates $D_{s0}^\\\\ast(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, require more advanced \
techniques, including the implementation of meson creation operators composed \
of two quarks and two antiquarks and possibly studies of the volume \
dependence of the masses of corresponding scattering states\\\\footnote{For a \
basic introduction on how to study resonances using lattice QCD, cf.\\\\ Ref.\
\\\\ \\\\cite{Prelovsek:2011nk}.}. Examples of recent lattice QCD papers \
exploring and using such techniques to study specific $D$, $D_s$ or \
charmonium states are Refs.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Gong:2011nr,Mohler:2012na,Liu:2012zya,Prelovsek:2013cra,\\nPrelovsek:\
2013xba,Mohler:2013rwa,Ikeda:2013vwa,Lang:2014yfa,Prelovsek:2014swa,Guerrieri:\
2014nxa}.\\n\\nThe goal of this paper is to compute the masses of several \
low-lying $D$ meson, $D_s$ meson and charmonium states using Wilson twisted \
mass lattice QCD with 2+1+1 dynamical quark flavors. One of the main \
advantages of this particular discretization of QCD is automatic \
$\\\\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement, i.e.\\\\ discretization errors appear only \
quadratically in the small lattice spacing $a$ and are, hence, strongly \
suppressed. From a technical point of view, we employ a large variety of \
quark-antiquark meson creation operators and are, hence, able to address \
total angular momentum $J = 0,1,2$, parity $\\\\mathcal{P} = -,+$ and in case \
of charmonium charge conjugation $\\\\mathcal{C} = -,+$.\\n% notation \
throughout the paper:\\n% J: total angular momentum\\n% L: orbital angular \
momentum\\n% S: spin\\nComputations have been performed for ten different \
gauge link ensembles with unphysically heavy $u/d$ quark masses corresponding \
to pion masses $m_\\\\pi \\\\approx 225 \\\\ldots 470 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$ \
and with lattice spacings $a \\\\approx 0.0619 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm} \\\\, , \
\\\\, 0.0815 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm} \\\\, , \\\\, 0.0885 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm}$. \
Moreover, each meson mass has been computed twice using two different valence \
Wilson twisted mass quark discretizations. This rather large amount of \
lattice data allows solid extrapolations both to physically light $u/d$ quark \
masses and to the continuum. Moreover, finite volume effects have been \
investigated and found to be negligible.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, some $D$ \
meson, $D_s$ meson and charmonium states are quite unstable or might have a \
structure significantly different from a quark-antiquark pair. Even though we \
present results for these states in this work, a rigorous treatment will \
require more advanced techniques, in particular the inclusion of four-quark \
creation operators as discussed above. We are in the process of developing \
such techniques using a similar lattice QCD setup \
\\\\cite{Alexandrou:2012rm,Abdel-Rehim:2014zwa,Berlin:2015faa}. The \
techniques and results presented in this paper are an important prerequisite \
for such more advanced computations.\\n\\nParts of this work have been \
presented at recent conferences \
\\\\cite{Kalinowski:2012re,Kalinowski:2013wsa,Wagner:2013laa,Cichy:2015tma} \
and certain technical aspects are discussed in detail in Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa}.\\n\\nThis paper is structured as follows. In \
Section~\\\\ref{sec:setup}, we summarize the 2+1+1 flavor Wilson twisted mass \
lattice QCD setup and the meson creation operators we use. We also explain in \
detail how we tune the strange and charm quark masses, and how we extrapolate \
the meson masses to physically light $u/d$ quark masses and to the continuum. \
In Section~\\\\ref{sec:results}, we present our results for $D$ and $D_s$ \
mesons and for charmonium states and discuss and quantify all possible error \
sources. These results are summarized in plots and tables in \
Section~\\\\ref{sec:summary}, where we also give a brief \
outlook.\\n\\n\\n\\n% ********************\\n% ********************\\n% \

improved \\\\cite{Frezzotti:2003ni,Frezzotti:2004wz,Frezzotti:2005gi,\
Chiarappa:2006ae}. The tuning has been done by adjusting $m_0$ such that the \
PCAC quark mass in the light quark sector vanishes (cf.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Baron:2010bv} for details). For a review on Wilson twisted mass \
lattice QCD, we refer to Ref.\\\\ \\\\cite{Shindler:2007vp}.\\n\\nIn this \
work, we use ten ensembles, which differ in the light $u/d$ quark mass \
(corresponding pion masses $225 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV} \\\\ltapprox m_\\\\pi \
\\\\ltapprox 470 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$), the lattice spacing $0.0619 \\\\, \
\\\\textrm{fm} \\\\ltapprox a \\\\ltapprox 0.0885 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm}$ and \
the spacetime volume (scale setting via the pion mass and the pion decay \
constant \\\\cite{Carrasco:2014cwa}). The $s$ and the $c$ quark masses are \
represented by $\\\\mu_\\\\sigma$ and $\\\\mu_\\\\delta$. These values have \
been chosen such that the lattice QCD results for $2 m_K^2 - m_\\\\pi^2$ and \
for $m_D$, quantities which depend only weakly on the light $u/d$ quark mass, \
are close to the corresponding physical values \
\\\\cite{Baron:2010bv,Baron:2010th,Baron:2010vp}. Details of these gauge link \
ensembles are collected in Table~\\\\ref{tab.ensembles}. Ensemble A40.24 is \
not used to generate final results for meson masses, but only to confirm the \
absence of finite volume effects (cf.\\\\ Section\\\\ \

\\\\chi^{(2)}$ as e.g.\\\\ appearing in (\\\\ref{EQN507}) to the physical \

of twisted basis doublets. In the columns ``tb, $(\\\\pm,\\\\mp)$'' and ``tb, \

left with $\\\\pm i \\\\gamma_5$ to obtain the corresponding twisted \
$\\\\Gamma$.\\n\\nIsospin $I$ and parity $\\\\mathcal{P}$ are symmetries of \
QCD. While in Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD the $z$ component of isospin \
$I_z$ is still a quantum number, $I$ and $\\\\mathcal{P}$ are broken by \

identical correlation functions. At finite lattice spacing, $(+,-)$ and \
$(+,+)$ correlation functions slightly differ due to discretization errors. \
As a consequence, $D$ meson masses computed on the one hand with a $(+,+)$ \
and on the other hand with a $(+,-)$ flavor combination, but which are \
otherwise identical, will differ in mass. Due to automatic \
$\\\\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement of Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD at maximal \
twist, this mass splitting will be proportional to $a^2$, i.e.\\\\ is \
expected to be rather small and will vanish quadratically when approaching \
the continuum limit. This theoretical expectation is confirmed by our \
numerical results shown in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:results}. We use both \
$(+,-)$ results and $(+,+)$ results when performing continuum extrapolations.\
\\n\\nNote that parity is not a symmetry, i.e.\\\\ there is no rigorous \
separation between $\\\\mathcal{P} = +$ and $\\\\mathcal{P} = -$ states in \
Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. Nevertheless, it is possible to assign \
parity quantum numbers to the extracted meson masses in a clean and \
unambigous way (cf.\\\\ \\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa}, Section~4.2 for a \
detailed numerical example).\\n\\nIdentical considerations apply for $D_s$ \
mesons, when replacing $(u,d) \\\\rightarrow (s^+,s^-)$.\\n\\nFor charmonium \

only five different irreducible representations of the cubic group \
$\\\\mathrm{O}$ (labeled by $A_1$, $T_1$, $E$, $T_2$, $A_2$). For our \
creation operators, we list the corresponding representations for spin, \

techniques. This allows to read off meson masses from the exponential decay \
of correlation functions at rather small temporal separations, where the \
signal-to-noise ratio is favorable. Smearing is done in two steps. First, we \
replace spatial gauge links by their APE smeared counterparts \
\\\\cite{Albanese:1987ds}. Then, we use Gaussian smearing on the quark fields \
$\\\\chi^{(l)}$, $\\\\chi^{(s)}$ and $\\\\chi^{(c)}$, which resorts to the \
APE smeared spatial links. The parameters we have chosen are \
$N_\\\\textrm{APE} = 10$, $\\\\alpha_\\\\textrm{APE} = 0.5$, \
$N_\\\\textrm{Gauss} = 30, 36, 65$ (for A, B and D ensembles, respectively) \
and $\\\\kappa_\\\\textrm{Gauss} = 0.5$. This corresponds to a Gaussian width \
of the smeared quark fields of approximately $0.24 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm}$. Cf.\

parity quantum number as well as information regarding the structure of the \
meson (e.g.\\\\ which spin or orbital angular momentum is dominant). For a \
detailed discussion, we refer to Ref.\\\\ \\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa}, \
Section\\\\ 4.2.\\n\\n% \
**********\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{\\\\label{SEC595}Tuning $s$ and $c$ valence \
quark masses to their physical values}\\n\\\\label{sec:tuning}\\n\\nWe tune \
the $s$ and $c$ valence quark masses via $2 m_K^2 - m_\\\\pi^2$ (which does \
not depend on the $u/d$ quark mass at leading order of chiral perturbation \
theory) and $m_D$ (which does only weakly depend of the $u/d$ quark mass). \
For that purpose, we use experimental results for the masses of the \
electrically neutral mesons $\\\\pi^0$, $K^0$ and $D^0$ in the case of \
neutral charm-light and charm-charm mesons, whereas for the charged \
charm-light and charm-strange mesons, we instead use the electrically charged \
mesons $\\\\pi^\\\\pm$, $K^\\\\pm$ and $D^\\\\pm$.\\nThe idea behind this \
choice is that for neutral (charged) mesons, the electrical charges are \
opposite (combine to $\\\\pm1$) both for the input meson masses used for \
quark mass tuning as well as for all the meson masses predicted by our \
lattice QCD computation.\\nEven though electromagnetism is not part of our \
lattice setup, we expect that by using this procedure, electromagnetic \
effects are to a sizable extent incorporated in the quark mass tuning. \\nAs \
we will discuss in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:results}, when analyzing our \
results, this procedure seems to work very well, i.e.\\\\ for states, which \
can be computed with small statistical errors of $\\\\ltapprox 5 \\\\, \
\\\\textrm{MeV}$ (e.g.\\\\ the $D_s$ meson, $\\\\eta_c(1S)$ and \
$J/\\\\psi(1S)$), we obtain perfect agreement with experimental results. \
\\nOn the other hand, when performing the tuning in the non-ideal opposite \
way, e.g.\\\\ using neutral mesons for quark mass tuning to predict the $D_s$ \
meson mass, the lattice result differs from its experimental counterpart by $\
\\\\approx 5 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$, which is the typical order of magnitude \
of isospin breaking effects in meson masses.\\n\\nWe also note that to \
compute $2 m_K^2 - m_\\\\pi^2$ and $m_D$ for the $s$ and $c$ valence quark \
mass tuning, we always use the $(+,-)$ discretization, which is known to \
yield smaller discretization errors for these pseudoscalar \
mesons\\\\footnote{Moreover, the calculation of the pion mass using the \
$(+,+)$ discretization requires the computation of disconnected diagrams, \
which would lead to significantly larger statistical errors and hence less \
precise $s$ and $c$ valence quark mass tuning.} \
\\\\cite{Urbach:2007rt,Frezzotti:2007qv}.\\n\\nThe technical aspects of the \
tuning procedure are explained in more detail in Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa}. For each ensemble (characterized by $a$ and $m_\
\\\\pi \\\\equiv m_\\\\pi^{(+,-)}$), we perform computations of $m_K$ for two \
valence $s$ quark masses $\\\\mu_{s,1}$ and $\\\\mu_{s,2}$, different by \
around $10 \\\\%$ and both in the region of the physical $s$ quark mass. The \
physical valence $s$ quark mass can then be determined according \
to\\n%\\n\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\n\\\\nonumber & & \\\\hspace{-0.7cm} \\\\mu_{s,\

$X^{(+,-)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s) \\\\equiv 2 \
(m_K^{(+,-)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s))^2 - m_\\\\pi)^2$ and $X_{\\\\textrm{exp}} \
= 2 m_{K^0}^2 - m_{\\\\pi^0}^2 \\\\approx 0.477 \\\\, \\\\textrm{GeV}^2$ (for \
neutral mesons) or $X_{\\\\textrm{exp}} = 2 m_{K^\\\\pm}^2 - \
m_{\\\\pi^\\\\pm}^2 \\\\approx 0.467 \\\\, \\\\textrm{GeV}^2$ (for charged \
mesons). Analogously, the physical valence $c$ quark mass \
is\\n%\\n\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\n\\\\nonumber & & \\\\hspace{-0.7cm} \\\\mu_{c,\
\\\\textrm{phys}}(a,m_\\\\pi) \\\\ \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mu_{c,2}(a,m_\\\\pi) \

m_D^{(+,-)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_{c,2})} ,\\n\\\\end{eqnarray}\\n%\\nwhere \
$m_{D_\\\\textrm{exp}}\\\\approx1.865$ GeV (for neutral mesons) or \
$m_{D_\\\\textrm{exp}}\\\\approx1.870$ GeV (for charged mesons).\\n\\nAn \
example of the tuning of $s$ and $c$ valence quark masses (for neutral \
mesons) to their physical values for ensemble A80.24 is shown in \
Figure~\\\\ref{fig:tuning} (the red dots correspond to $\\\\mu_{s,1}$, \
$\\\\mu_{s,2}$, $\\\\mu_{c,1}$ and $\\\\mu_{c,2}$, the black dots to \
$\\\\mu_{s,\\\\textrm{phys}}$ and $\\\\mu_{c,\\\\textrm{phys}}$). For this \
specific case, we also performed computations for a third $s$ and $c$ valence \
quark mass, $\\\\mu_{s,3}$ and $\\\\mu_{c,3}$ (represented by the blue points \
in Figure~\\\\ref{fig:tuning}). This shows that the linear dependence of $2 \
(m_K^{(+,-)})^2 - m_\\\\pi^2$ and $m_D^{(+,-)}$ on $\\\\mu_s$ and $\\\\mu_c$ \
assumed in (\\\\ref{EQN753}) and (\\\\ref{EQN754}), respectively, is well \
satisfied for our numerical data with only a tiny deviation from the linear \
behavior observed in the case of $m_D^{(+,-)}$.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\

masses to physically light $u/d$ quark masses and to the \
continuum}\\n\\\\label{sec:fits}\\n\\nWe use the procedure described in the \
previous subsection to compute meson masses for nine of the ten ensembles \
listed in Table~\\\\ref{tab.ensembles} using both the $(+,-)$ and the $(+,+)$ \
valence quark discretization (ensemble A40.24 is only used to exclude finite \
volume effects; cf.\\\\ Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:FVE}). Then, we extrapolate \
these meson masses to physically light $u/d$ quark masses (for simplicity, \
also denoted as the chiral extrapolation in the following) and to the \
continuum. For each meson state, we perform an independent fit to the \
corresponding 18 lattice QCD masses $m^{(+,\\\\pm)}(a,m_\\\\pi)$ (nine \
ensembles characterized by $a$ and $m_\\\\pi$, two discretizations $(+,-)$ \
and $(+,+)$).\\n\\nOur most general fitting ansatz is first order in $a^2$ \
(discretization errors proportional to $a$ are excluded due to automatic \
$\\\\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement of Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD) and \
linear in $m_\\\\pi^2$ (typically the leading order in chiral perturbation \
theory):\\n%\\n\\\\begin{eqnarray}\\n\\\\label{eq:TM} & & \\\\hspace{-0.7cm} \

\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$ are fitting parameters and $m_{\\\\pi^0,\\\\textrm{exp}} \
\\\\approx 135 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$\\\\,\\\\footnote{For both the neutral \
and charged meson masses, we extrapolate to the mass of the neutral pion. The \
difference in meson masses if the charged pion mass is taken for \
extrapolating to the physical light quark mass is negligible with respect to \
the total error, in contrast to the effect of taking neutral/charged \
$\\\\pi$, $K$ and $D$ meson masses for the $s$ and $c$ quark masses tuning \
described in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:tuning}.}. We adopt three slightly \
different strategies to obtain and cross-check $u/d$ quark mass and continuum \
extrapolated results for meson masses.\\n%\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item \\\
\\textbf{Strategy 1} \\\\\\\\\\nWe take $m^{(+,-)}$, $m^{(+,+)}$, \
$c^{(+,-)}$, $c^{(+,+)}$, $\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}$ and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$ as six \
independent fitting parameters. In this case, the fits of (\\\\ref{eq:TM}) to \
$(+,-)$ lattice QCD results and of (\\\\ref{eq:OS}) to $(+,+)$ lattice QCD \
results decouple and we obtain for each meson mass two independent estimates \
$m^{(+,-)}$ and $m^{(+,+)}$, respectively. Since these estimates correspond \
to different discretizations, this strategy allows to test their universality \
($m^{(+,-)}$ and $m^{(+,+)}$ should coincide).\\n\\n\\\\item \
\\\\textbf{Strategy 2} \\\\\\\\\\nAlternatively, we can take this \
universality as granted and set $m^{(+,-)} \\\\equiv m^{(+,+)} \\\\equiv m$, \
leaving five fitting parameters, $m$, $c^{(+,-)}$, $c^{(+,+)}$, \
$\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}$ and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$. This allows to perform a single \
combined $u/d$ quark mass and continuum extrapolation using both \
discretizations simultaneously.\\n\\n\\\\item \\\\textbf{Strategy 3} \\\\\\\\\
\\nWe can additionally assume that the slope of the chiral extrapolation is \
discretization independent, i.e.\\\\ set $\\\\alpha^{(+,-)} = \
\\\\alpha^{(+,+)} \\\\equiv \\\\alpha$ and perform fits with four fitting \
parameters, $m$, $c^{(+,-)}$, $c^{(+,+)}$ and $\\\\alpha$. This assumption \
seems reasonable, because any discretization dependence of the $u/d$ quark \
mass dependence is expected to be of higher order, i.e.\\\\ \
$\\\\mathcal{O}(a^2 (m_\\\\pi^2 - \
m_{\\\\pi^0,\\\\textrm{exp}}^2))$.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n%\\nIn the following, \
our preferred fitting strategy is \\\\textbf{Strategy 2} and all results \
presented in the following have been generated accordingly. Note, however, \
that we have cross-checked these results by also using the other two \
strategies, thereby confirming universality of our two valence quark \
discretizations as well as discretization independence of the $u/d$ quark \
mass dependence (see Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:ansatz} for more \
details).\\n\\n% \
**********\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{\\\\label{sec:analysis}Determination of \
statistical and systematic errors}\\n\\\\label{sec:syst}\\n\\nThe input meson \
masses $m^{(+,\\\\pm)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)$ for the quark mass and \
continuum extrapolations are extracted from correlation matrices \
(\\\\ref{EQN698}) by solving generalized eigenvalue problems, as discussed in \
Section~\\\\ref{SEC609}. For each meson mass \
$m^{(+,\\\\pm)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)$, one needs to decide for a \
temporal fitting interval, where a constant (representing \
$m^{(+,\\\\pm)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)$) is fitted to the \
corresponding effective mass. Therefore, the obtained input meson masses as \
well as the subsequently generated extrapolations depend to some extent on \
the chosen fitting intervals. To arrive at results which are quite \
independent of a possibly somewhat arbitrary single specific choice of such \
fitting intervals, we adopt a systematic procedure. This procedure combines \
results obtained by choosing a variety of fitting intervals and provides an \
estimate of the related uncertainty by taking the spread of these results \
into account.\\n\\nOur procedure is applied independently to each meson \
state. It consists of the following \
steps:\\n%\\n\\\\begin{enumerate}\\n\\\\item For each ensemble, each valence \
quark discretization and each $s$ and $c$ valence quark mass, i.e.\\\\ for \
each meson mass $m^{(+,\\\\pm)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)$, choose the \
minimal Euclidean time for extracting the meson mass from the corresponding \
effective mass, $t_{\\\\rm min}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)/a$, as the \
smallest $t/a$ for which a fit in the interval $[t/a,\\\\,t/a+2]$ yields a \
$\\\\chi^2/{\\\\rm dof} \\\\leq 1.3$. (This we take as an indication that the \
contamination by excited states is of the same order of magnitude or smaller \
than statistical errors.)\\n\\n\\\\item For each ensemble, each valence quark \
discretization and each $s$ and $c$ valence quark mass, i.e.\\\\ for each \
meson mass $m^{(+,\\\\pm)}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)$, choose the maximal \
time for extracting the meson mass from the corresponding effective mass, \
$t_{\\\\rm max}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)/a$, as the largest $t/a$ for \
which the statistical error of the effective mass is still smaller than five \
times the error of the effective mass at time $t_{\\\\rm \
min}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)/a$. (In this way data points with rather \
large statistical errors, which usually do not contain any useful \
information, are excluded.)\\n\\n\\\\item Given $t_{\\\\rm min}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\
\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)/a$ and $t_{\\\\rm max}(a,m_\\\\pi,\\\\mu_s,\\\\mu_c)/a$, \

the case of $\\\\eta_c(1S)$, the extracted estimates $m_n$ are essentially \
independent of the choice of the fitting range for effective mass plateaus. \
Consequently, the systematic uncertainty is small and the total error is \
close to the statistical error, which is nearly the same for all 13 plateau \
choices. Hence, our procedure generates essentially the same result as one \
would obtain by a less evolved analysis of choosing a single specific \
effective mass plateau.\\n\\nIn the case of $D_{s2}^*(2573)$, the situation \
is rather opposite. The choice of the effective mass plateau has strong \
influence on the resulting meson mass, i.e.\\\\ the extracted estimates $m_n$ \
differ within statistical errors by a few $\\\\sigma$. Correspondingly, our \
systematic procedure generates a rather large systematic uncertainty, which \
represents the spread of the estimates $m_n$. This systematic uncertainty is \
significantly larger than any of the statistical errors of the $m_n$ and, \
hence, dominates the total error. For such cases, we consider our systematic \
procedure more conservative and the corresponding results hence superior \
compared to results obtained by just deciding for a single specific fitting \
interval for each effective mass.\\nNote, however, that if the meson mass \
systematically drops down when the fit starts at larger Euclidean times, as \
for $D_{s2}^*(2573)$, the resulting fitting range uncertainty may still be \
underestimated.\\nIn such case, the proper identification of this systematic \
error would require going to even larger $t/a$, which is impossible due to \
the strongly decreasing signal-to-noise ratio at large $t/a$.\\nIn our \
discussion of specific states in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:results}, we will \
always emphasize this whenever this is the \
case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Results}\\n\\\\label{sec:results}\\nIn \
this section, we discuss our results, in particular the chiral and continuum \
extrapolations for the meson masses considered in this work.\\nWe begin with \
some general remarks valid for all states.\\n\\nFor each state, we provide a \
plot showing all 18 data points corresponding to nine of the ten ensembles \
listed in Table\\\\ \\\\ref{tab.ensembles} and the two different \
discretizations of valence quarks, $(+,-)$ and $(+,+)$.\\nEach such plot \
shows data from fitting intervals corresponding to the central value \
according to our systematic procedure (cf. Section~\\\\ref{sec:syst}), e.g.\\\
\\ the black points and error bars in  Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:syst}.\\nThe \
straight lines in every plot are fits of equations (\\\\ref{eq:TM}) and \
(\\\\ref{eq:OS}).\\nWe remark that the 18 meson masses at a fixed lattice \
spacing and pion mass are plotted only with statistical errors.\\nHence, in \
cases when the systematic error dominates over the statistical one, the \
$\\\\chi^2/{\\\\rm dof}$ can be significantly larger than 1.\\nHowever, when \
the systematic error is taken into account in the definition of the \
$\\\\chi^2$ function, we always obtain values of $\\\\chi^2/{\\\\rm dof}$ \
indicating good fits, i.e.\\\\ $\\\\chi^2/{\\\\rm dof}\\\\approx1$.\\n\\nThe \
obtained continuum result at the physical pion mass is compared to the \
experimental value given in the latest PDG review \\\\cite{PDG}, with updates \
from the online version of PDG, available under \
\\\\url{http://pdglive.lbl.gov}.\\n\\nThe correlation matrices, in particular \
their size and operator content, is the same as in Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa} (see Sections 4 and 5 of this reference for \
details).\\n\\n\\\\subsection{$D$ mesons}\\nWe start with mesons containing a \
charm quark and a light quark, i.e.\\\\ with $D$ mesons.\\nThe plots refer to \
our computations of neutral $D$ mesons, which differ from their charged \
counterparts only in the strange and charm quark masses tuning (cf. \
Sections\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:tuning} and \\\\ref{sec:fits}).\\nPlots for charged \
$D$ mesons are qualitatively identical and hence not shown.\\nThe final \
results for both cases are collected in Table\\\\ \\\\ref{tab:all}.\\nNote \
that our estimates of electromagnetic effects and effects from different $u$ \
and $d$ quark masses are very crude (for a more detailed discussion, cf.\\\\ \
Section~\\\\ref{sec:tuning} \
and~\\\\ref{sec:isospin}).\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\

}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{$A_1$ \
representation (spin $J=0$)}\\n\\\\label{sec:DA1}\\nThe ground state \
corresponds to the $D$ meson ($J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=0^-$) and the first excited \
state to the $D_0^*$ meson ($J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=0^+$). \\nAs mentioned above, \
these states have to be extracted from a single correlation matrix due to \
twisted mass parity breaking -- even though these states are in different \
channels in the continuum (different parity), they belong to the same sector \
in twisted mass lattice QCD.\\nThe $A_1$ representation corresponds to \
continuum spins $J=0,4,\\\\ldots$, but the $J=4$ and higher states are \
expected to be much heavier than the $J=0$ ones.\\nHence, it should be \
appropriate to assume that these low-lying states have $J=0$.\\n\\nThe mass \
of the $D$ meson computed with the $(+,-)$ discretization is used for the \
tuning of the charm quark. Hence, for this case we only perform a combined \
chiral and continuum extrapolation using the $(+,+)$ discretization (see \
Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:D}).\\nWe find a result compatible with the PDG value, \
which confirms that the $(+,+)$ discretization indeed yields the same \
continuum results, as guaranteed by universality (see also Section\\\\ \
\\\\ref{sec:ansatz} for a more systematic comparison of results obtained from \
both discretizations independently).\\nOf course, when using the experimental \
charged $\\\\pi$, $K$ and $D$ meson masses for the tuning of the strange and \
charm quark, our $(+,+)$ result is consistent with the PDG mass of the \
charged $D$ meson, as \
expected.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

(Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:D0star}) in this sector is the $D_0^*$ meson (with \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=0^+$).\\nThe eigenvectors resulting from the generalized \
eigenvalue problem provide information about the structure of the $D_0^*$. \
They suggest that it is a roughly equal mixture of four $\\\\Gamma$ \
structures ($\\\\Gamma=\\\\mathbbm{1},\\\\gamma_0,\\\\gamma_j\\\\textbf{n}_j,\
\\\\gamma_0\\\\gamma_j\\\\textbf{n}_j$), leading to the conclusion that this \
meson is a roughly equal superposition of $S$ and $P$ waves.\\nThis is \
interesting, because in quark model calculations this state is often \
considered to be a pure $P$ wave state.\\nOur continuum value of the $D_0^*$ \
meson mass is compatible with the experimental value.\\nHowever, the behavior \
with changing light quark mass is somewhat untypical -- the meson mass \
increases significantly with increasing light quark mass for A and B \
ensembles, whereas this dependence is reversed for D ensembles.\\nThis might \
be related to the fact that this state can decay to a $D$ meson and a pion \
and has a rather large width of $\\\\Gamma=267(40)$ MeV.\\nIn other words, \
the state that we extract may contain a two-meson contribution with the same \
quantum numbers, $D+\\\\pi$, where the presence of the pion could be the \
reason for the dependence on the light quark mass.\\nTherefore, this state \
may require a more sophisticated lattice treatment, taking the possibility of \
such a decay explicitly into account, as explored e.g.\\\\ in Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Mohler:2012na}.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\

representation (spin $J=1$)}\\n\\\\label{sec:DT1}\\nThe $T_1$ representation \
corresponds to continuum spins $J=1,3,4,\\\\ldots$ and again it seems \
reasonable to assume that the low-lying states that we extract are all $J=1$ \
states. Note that the $J=3$ states appear also in the $T_2$ representation \
and finding a state at a similar mass in both $T_1$ and $T_2$ is hence an \
indication that it is $J=3$. On the other hand, $T_1$ representation states \
with no counterpart in the $T_2$ representation are most likely \
$J=1$.\\n\\nThe lowest $T_1$ charm-light state is the $D^*$ meson \
($J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=1^-$), see Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:Dstar}.\\nThe $D^*$ \
meson can not decay to $D+\\\\pi$ at our values of the pion mass, hence our \
computation should not be affected by two-meson contributions with the same \
quantum numbers.\\nThe value we get is slightly above the PDG result when \
only the statistical error is taken into account.\\nHowever, after \
considering the fitting range uncertainty, we get agreement with experiment \
within the total error (represented by orange boxes in our \
plots).\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\includegraphics[\

excitations in this channel, both with $J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=1^+$, we again use \
the eigenvector components obtained from the generalized eigenvalue problem \
to resolve the structure. \\nThis is particularly important for these states, \
since their experimental masses are very close and hence the assignment of \
lattice results to the two states characterized by the spin of the light \
degrees of freedom $j\\\\approx1/2$ and $j\\\\approx3/2$ is not \
straightforward.\\nNevertheless, it can be done in an unambiguous way, which \
we described in detail in Ref.\\\\ \\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa}, Section\\\\ \
5.1.2.\\nAccording to the arguments presented there, the $D_1(2430)$ has $j\\\
\\approx1/2$, while the $D_1(2420)$ has $j\\\\approx3/2$.\\nThis implies that \
only the former can decay via an $S$ wave (to $D^*+\\\\pi$) and our lattice \
treatment of this state in terms of quark-antiquark operators may again be \
too simple.\\nOn the other hand, the latter is protected by angular momentum \
$j\\\\approx3/2$ and hence this decay is strongly suppressed.\\nOur combined \
chiral and continuum extrapolation is, however, in good agreement with the \
experimental value for $D_1(2430)$ (Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:D1}), while for \
$D_1(2420)$ (Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:D1a}), we obtain a result which is almost \
$4\\\\,\\\\sigma$ away, even after considering the uncertainty from the \
fitting range.\\nIt is interesting to note that $j\\\\approx3/2$ static-light \
mesons came out too heavy using a similar lattice QCD setup, with a similar \
discrepancy with respect to the experimental result \\\\cite{Michael:2010aa}.\
\\nHence, it is not too surprising that also in the present computation, we \
encounter the same problem.\\nA possible explanation of this fact is that the \
creation operator used to to extract the meson might not generate a trial \
state similar enough to the $D_1(2420)$.\\nIn practice, this would lead to a \
contamination of the considered correlation function with higher excited \
states.\\nThus, one would need to go to later Euclidean times to disentangle \
the $D_1(2420)$ from the next excited state.\\nIndeed, this explanation is \
favoured by our present data, since the meson mass decreases when it is \
extracted from plateau fitting intervals starting at higher $t/a$ (the plot \
is qualitatively similar to the lower right plot of Figure\\\\ \
\\\\ref{fig:syst}).\\nHowever, before a definite conclusion can be reached, \
the signal-to-noise ratio drops too much, i.e.\\\\ it is not excluded that \
fits starting at even higher $t/a$ would give even smaller values of the \
mass, thus lowering our preferred central value and increasing the fitting \
range uncertainty.\\nAnother hint for this interpretation is provided by the \
results from our finest lattice spacing (D ensembles, blue points in Figure\\\
\\ \\\\ref{fig:D1a}).\\nFor these ensembles, the temporal extent of the \
lattice is $T/a=48$ (as compared to $T/a=32$ or $T/a=24$ for the other \
ensembles) and hence larger Euclidean times in lattice units can be \
reached.\\nConsequently, if the chiral extrapolation is performed using these \
ensembles alone, the obtained result is much closer to the experimental value \
and at this lattice spacing the cut-off effects should be rather small.\\nThe \
situation is similar for some of our higher orbital or radial excitations, \
but mostly with smaller discrepancies to experimental results of around \
$2\\\\,\\\\sigma$. In such cases, more precise data at larger temporal \
separations or better optimized creation operators might be needed to clarify \
the situation and to obtain more robust \
results.\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

and $E$ representations (spin $J=2$)}\\n\\\\label{sec:DT2E}\\nThe $T_2$ \
representation contains continuum spins $J=2,3,4,\\\\ldots$, while the $E$ \
representation contains $J=2,4,\\\\ldots$.\\nThus, if a state with similar \
mass is present in both $T_2$ and $E$, it should corresponds to spin $J=2$ or \
$J=4$ (although the latter is most likely excluded for low lying \
states).\\n\\nWe extracted three states in the $J=2$ channel (i.e.\\\\ from \
both representations $T_2$ and $E$), the $D_2^*(2460)$ with \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=2^+$ (Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:D2} for the $E$ \
representation) and two other states of opposite parity, with unknown \
experimental counterparts. \\n\\nFor the former, the statistical error is \
quite large and the plateau quality is not very good, which is reflected in \
the size of the systematic uncertainty related to the choice of the fitting \
interval.\\nMoreover, our systematic procedure of extracting the fitting \
range uncertainty again points to a possible contamination by excited states, \
since the results for increasing shift parameter $n$ (again, the plot for \
different fitting ranges resembles the lower right plot of Figure\\\\ \
\\\\ref{fig:syst}) go down systematically.\\nHowever, again the \
signal-to-noise ratio decreases too quickly to reach a definite \
conclusion.\\nMoreover, the mass value from chiral fits using only our D \
ensembles is much closer to the experimental value than the one from the \
chiral and continuum extrapolation taking all ensembles into \
account.\\nHence, we interpret the observed discrepancy as a sign that this \
state is among those for which the lattice techniques need to be improved for \
a reliable extraction, e.g.\\\\ by using operators with better overlap with \
the desired state.\\n\\nThe other two extracted states in this channel \
($J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=2^-$) suffer even more from the aforementioned \
problem.\\nTherefore, we do not quote any value for them.\\nWe only remark \
that the chiral extrapolation from only the D ensembles leads to a value \
consistent with the experimental one for the $D(2750)$ meson.\\nThe presence \
of another state with these quantum numbers points to the possible existence \
of another, rather closely lying state, which can be expected to be \
discovered experimentally (two close lying states with \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=2^-$ were also oberved in Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Mohler:2011ke}).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{\

precisely (Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:Ds}), i.e.\\\\ with a relative error \
smaller than two per mille, which is the best precision from among all our \
states.\\nWe find agreement with experiment and the effective mass plateau \
quality is very good such that the uncertainty from the choice of the fitting \
range is slightly smaller than the statistical error (see the upper right \
plot of Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:syst}).\\nThe precision of the data allows \
also to obtain the slopes of the chiral extrapolation ($\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}$ \
and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$) with small statistical errors and we find that they \
are compatible: $-0.166(12)$ and $-0.168(13)$, respectively. \\nThis confirms \
the expectation that discretization effects in the $\\\\alpha$ parameters are \
quite small, i.e.\\\\ that higher order terms proportional to $a^2(m_\\\\pi^2 \
- m_{\\\\pi,\\\\textrm{exp}}^2)$ are negligible in equations (\\\\ref{eq:TM}) \

$(+,-)$ setup are much smaller ($c^{(+,-)}=-1.0(4)$) than those in the \
$(+,+)$ setup ($c^{(+,+)}=+4.7(4)$).\\nThis again agrees with our \
expectations -- as mentioned above, the $(+,-)$ setup is known to usually \
give smaller cut-off effects in comparison with the $(+,+)$ valence quark \
discretization for light-light and heavy-light pseudoscalar \
mesons.\\nHowever, this is not the case for all investigated mesons and we \

channel (Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:Ds2}), using both the $E$ and the $T_2$ \
representation -- the $D_{s2}^*(2573)$ meson ($J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=2^+$).\\nAs \
for the analogous charm-light state ($D_2^*(2460)$), we observe a rather poor \
effective mass plateau quality, with no obvious choice of the fitting \
interval.\\nOur systematic procedure to capture such effects hence generates \
a large uncertainty (70..80 MeV, see the lower right plot of Figure\\\\ \
\\\\ref{fig:syst} for the $E$ representation).\\nWithin the combined \
statistical and systematic uncertainty, our result is consistent with the \
experimental value.\\n\\nWe also observe two states with \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{P}}=2^-$, but the quality of the data is not good enough to \
quote a meaningful and trustworthy value (cf.\\\\ also Section\\\\ \
\\\\ref{sec:DT2E} for a discussion of the corresponding charm-light \

nAs in Ref.\\\\ \\\\cite{Kalinowski:2015bwa}, we neglect disconnected \
diagrams in the computation of charmonium states.\\nAlthough this introduces \
a systematic error, it is expected to be tiny -- much smaller than \
statistical errors and systematic errors from other sources.\\nThe effects of \
disconnected diagrams were estimated in quenched lattice computations \
\\\\cite{Levkova:2010ft} and also perturbatively \
\\\\cite{Davies:2010ip,Gregory:2010gm,Donald:2012ga}, both estimates yielding \
shifts in the range of 1 MeV to 4 MeV.\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{$A_1$ \
representation (spin $J=0$)}\\nThe ground state charmonium is the \
$\\\\eta_c(1S)$ meson ($J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=0^{-+}$), see Figure\\\\ \
\\\\ref{fig:eta_c}. It can be extracted with excellent precision and the \
plateau quality is very good, such that the uncertainty from the choice of \
the fitting interval is negligible compared to the statistical error (see the \
upper left plot of Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:syst}).\\nThe slope of the chiral \
extrapolation has been determined rather precisely (with approximately \
10\\\\% precision) and again we find that the $(+,-)$ and $(+,+)$ \
discretizations have within errors the same pion mass dependence: \
$\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}=-0.259(23)$ and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}=-0.270(25)$.\\nIn the \
end, we obtain excellent agreement of our continuum extrapolated lattice \
result with experiment.\\nIt is interesting to note that we observe much \
smaller discretization effects in the $(+,+)$ setup than in the $(+,-)$ setup \
($c^{(+,-)}=-13.1(9)$, $c^{(+,+)}=-5.0(9)$).\\nHence, the often quoted rule \
that the $(+,-)$ setup leads to smaller cut-off effects (as is indeed the \
case e.g.\\\\ for the mesons used in the present work for tuning of strange \
and charm quark masses, i.e.\\\\ the $\\\\pi$, $K$ and $D$ mesons) is not \
universal, as will be discussed in more detail in Section\\\\ \
\\\\ref{sec:ansatz}.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

around $2\\\\,\\\\sigma$.\\nOur systematic procedure again reveals that the \
meson mass is decreasing with increasing shift parameter $n$, see the lower \
left plot of Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:syst}.\\nTo check the robustness of this \
result, one would need to go to even higher shifts (i.e.\\\\ fitting ranges \
starting and ending at later Euclidean times) and for this, the data quality \
is not sufficient.\\nAs before in cases of similar plateau quality, the \
extrapolation from the D ensembles alone, where the fitting range \
uncertainties are expected to be smaller (with small discretization effects \
in addition), leads to a value fully consistent with the PDG \
value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

representation (spin $J=1$)}\\n\\\\label{sec:ccT1}\\n\\nWe are able to \
extract four low lying $J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=1^{--}$ states in the $T_1$ \
representation.\\nThe mass of the ground state, the $J/\\\\psi(1S)$ meson, in \
the continuum limit and at physical quark masses (Figure\\\\ \
\\\\ref{fig:J-psi}), has been obtained with a relative error of less than two \
per mille.\\nIt allows again a precise comparison of the slopes of the chiral \
extrapolations: $\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}=-0.241(26)$ and \
$\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}=-0.240(24)$, i.e.\\\\ there is no difference between the \
two employed discretizations of valence quarks.\\nThe magnitude of cut-off \
effects is also similar for $(+,-)$ and $(+,+)$, but slightly smaller for the \
former ($c^{(+,-)}=-5.5(8)$, $c^{(+,+)}=-7.5(8)$).\\nWe also note very good \
effective mass plateau quality, resulting in negligible uncertainty from the \
choice of the fitting interval.\\n\\nThe first excitation with \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=1^{--}$ corresponds to the $\\\\psi(2S)$ meson (Figure\\\
\\ \\\\ref{fig:psi}) and its experimental mass is well reproduced in our \
computation.\\nFor the second excitation, the $\\\\psi(3770)$ meson (Figure \
\\\\ref{fig:psi3770}), we obtain a mass slightly larger than the PDG value, \
but still compatible within errors (discrepancy of around \
$1.5\\\\,\\\\sigma$).\\n\\nThe next excited state with \
${\\\\mathcal{PC}}={--}$ could either be the next excitation with \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=1^{--}$ or a state with higher spin (most probably \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=3^{--}$).\\nThe former interpretation is favoured, since \
we obtain a mass of 3.951(36) GeV (cf. Figure \\\\ref{fig:psiT1}) and we do \
not observe a state with a similar mass in the $T_2$ representation (thus \
$J=3$ seems unlikely; however, it can not be excluded, since the signal for \
it might be too weak in our computation) and neither any obvious counterpart \
in $A_1$ nor in $E$ (which should exclude spin $J=4$).\\nThe effective mass \
plateau quality is reasonable for this state, as well as the shift parameter \
plateau.\\nMoreover, the extracted continuum value is compatible with the one \
from D ensembles alone.\\nThis indicates that the estimated uncertainties are \
under control.\\nSince there is no experimental result available, we compare \
to another lattice calculation \\\\cite{Liu:2012ze} (at a single lattice \
spacing of 0.12 fm, much coarser than our coarsest one) and to a \
Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter approach \\\\cite{Fischer:2014cfa}, which \
both give masses in the range between 3.85 GeV and 3.9 GeV, i.e.\\\\ are \
qualitatively consistent with our result.\\n\\nWe find two mesons of positive \
parity in the $T_1$ representation -- the $\\\\chi_{c1}(1P)$ meson \
($J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=1^{++}$, Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:chi_c1}) and the \
$h_c(1P)$ meson ($J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=1^{+-}$, Figure\\\\ \
\\\\ref{fig:h_c}).\\nThe data quality for both these states is very good and \
we obtain excellent agreement with experimental \
values.\\n\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{$E$ and $T_2$ representations (spin $J=2$)}\
\\n\\nThe lowest lying state in both the $E$ and $T_2$ representations has a \
similar continuum value at physical quark masses and hence it can be \
attributed spin $J=2$.\\nExperimentally, it corresponds to the \
$\\\\chi_{c2}(1P)$ meson ($J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=2^{++}$).\\nWe obtain \
agreement with experiment and the total error is dominated by the fitting \
range uncertainty, which is much larger than the statistical error.\\nWe show \
our fits for the $E$ representation in Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:chi_c2} (the \
plot for the $T_2$ representation is very similar).\\n\\n\\nThe next \
extracted state in the $E$ representation (Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:psi1P}) has \
quantum numbers ${\\\\mathcal{PC}}={--}$. \\nMost probably, it corresponds to \
$J=2$, since a state with similar mass is also found in the $T_2$ \
representation.\\nAssuming $J=2$, it corresponds to the experimentally not \
established $\\\\psi_2(1P)$ meson.\\nWe again compare to Refs.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Liu:2012ze} and \\\\cite{Fischer:2014cfa}.\\nOur continuum and \
physical pion mass result is compatible with the lattice QCD result of Ref.\\\
\\ \\\\cite{Liu:2012ze} (only a single lattice spacing $a\\\\approx0.12$ fm) \
and around 200 MeV higher than the Bethe-Salpeter result of Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Fischer:2014cfa}.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second excitation in the $E$ \
representation corresponds to ${\\\\mathcal{PC}}={-+}$. It agrees within the \
total error with the lowest $T_2$ representation state with \
${\\\\mathcal{PC}}={-+}$ -- hence, it can be attributed $J=2$.\\nSuch a state \
is again experimentally not clearly identified, i.e.\\\\ it is not included \
in the PDG review.\\nThe naming scheme would suggest the name \
$\\\\eta_{c2}(1P)$.\\nOur continuum and chiral extrapolation for the $E$ \
representation state is shown in Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:eta_c2E}.\\nThe total \
error is dominated by the fitting uncertainty and we do not observe a clear \
plateau in the shift parameter dependence of the meson mass.\\nHence, our \
result should be treated with caution and needs to be confirmed in the \
future.\\nOur continuum and physical pion mass result is around 100 MeV \
higher than the lattice QCD and Bether-Salpeter results \
\\\\cite{Liu:2012ze,Fischer:2014cfa}, but we note that our result using only \
the coarsest lattice spacing (A ensembles) is compatible with Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Liu:2012ze} at a single and even coarser lattice \
spacing.\\n\\n\\nFinally, we extract one more state in the $E$ and $T_2$ \
representations, with quantum numbers ${\\\\mathcal{PC}}={++}$ (see \
Figure\\\\ \\\\ref{fig:chi_c2a}).\\nThe mass is close to 4.5 GeV, with a \
statistical uncertainty of around 30 MeV and a fitting range uncertainty \
between 50 MeV and 60 MeV.\\nSince it appears in both representations, it \
could have $J=2$ but also $J=4$ can not be excluded, taking into account the \
large value of the mass.\\nAt present, we are not able to clearly associate \
it to any experimentally observed state.\\nComparing to Ref.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Liu:2012ze}, we find that our A ensembles results (around \
4.05...4.15 GeV) are compatible with the result of this paper \
($a\\\\approx0.12$ fm), both for $J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=2^{++}$ and \
$J^{\\\\mathcal{PC}}=4^{++}$ (around 4 GeV and 4.1 GeV, \
respectively).\\nHowever, we predict that possible future experiments will \
find a higher mass, because our continuum result is around 4.5 GeV and the \
one from the D ensembles is between 4.2 GeV and 4.3 GeV.\\nDue to the rather \
poor signal quality and large cut-off effects, we do not quote a final value \
for this state.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Analysis of further \
systematic effects}\\nThe systematic errors are dominated by the fitting \
range uncertainties, which have already been discussed extensively.\\nWe now \
investigate and quantify other sources of systematic \
errors.\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{Finite volume \
effects}\\n\\\\label{sec:FVE}\\nWe expect that the finite volume effects \
(FVE) are small in our computation -- all our ensembles have rather large $m_\
\\\\pi L$ (with smallest $m_\\\\pi L$ of 3.4 and only three ensembles with \
$m_\\\\pi L<4$) and moreover, FVE are probably strongly suppressed because \
our meson creation operators do not directly generate additional pions but \
only excite much heavier mesons (none of our creation operators contains a \
light quark and a light antiquark).\\nNonetheless, we performed a dedicated \
analysis of FVE comparing ensembles A40.24 and A40.32, i.e.\\\\ two volumes \
with the same lattice spacing, with spatial lattice extents of around 2.1 fm \
($m_\\\\pi L\\\\approx3.5$) and 2.8 fm ($m_\\\\pi L\\\\approx4.5$), \
respectively.\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[t!]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

summary}Neutral $D$ meson, $D_s$ meson and charmonium masses using different \
strategies for the combined chiral and continuum extrapolation (see Section\\\
\\ \\\\ref{sec:fits}).}\\n\\\\end{table}\\n\\nAnother source of systematic \
uncertainty is related to the combined chiral and continuum \
extrapolation.\\nWe try to quantify this uncertainty by considering and \
comparing three different types of fitting ans\\\\\\\"atze, with six, five or \
four fitting parameters, as discussed in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:fits} \
(Strategy 1, Strategy 2 and Strategy 3, respectively).\\nIn Table\\\\ \
\\\\ref{tab:summary}, we list the chirally and continuum extrapolated values \
of the meson masses for all considered states (for charm-light mesons, we \
show results corresponding to neutral $D$ mesons; the results for the charged \
counterparts are collected in Table\\\\ \\\\ref{tab:all} only for Strategy 2, \
but differences due to the variation of fitting strategies are nearly \
identical).\\nFitting Strategy 2 and Strategy 3 assume a common continuum \
limit for the $(+,-)$ and $(+,+)$ valence quark discretizations and differ \
only in the additional assumption of a common (Strategy 3) or possibly \
different (Strategy 2) slope of the chiral extrapolation.\\nAs can be seen in \
the table, the resulting meson masses are almost identical -- hence, the \
assumption about a discretization independent slope of the chiral \
extrapolation seems to be justified.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Strategy 2 and \
Strategy 3 differ with respect to Strategy 1 in terms of the assumption about \
the common (Strategy 2 and Strategy 3) or possibly different (Strategy 1) \
final values for the meson masses obtained from both discretizations. \
Although common values are guaranteed by universality, both discretizations \
differ by cut-off effects and it is an important cross-check to confirm that \
universality is indeed satisfied.\\nWe find that the continuum extrapolated \
values from both discretizations agree with each other for almost all of our \
states within one standard deviation, with only three exceptions of higher \
excited states.\\nHence, these observations confirm universality.\\n\\nIn \
addition to testing universality, we also check whether the slopes of the \
chiral extrapolation agree within errors for both \
discretizations.\\nTable\\\\ \\\\ref{tab:summary2} contains the values of \
these slopes for all three fitting strategies (again, for $D$ mesons, we show \
results only for the neutral case; values for charged mesons are almost \
identical).\\nWe note that the statistical errors are rather similar for both \
discretizations and hence the common \
$\\\\alpha\\\\equiv\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}=\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$ (of Strategy 3) is \
always close to the average of $\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}$ and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$ \
(from Strategy 2 or Strategy 1 -- both yield very similar \
values).\\nMoreover, $\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}$ and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$ are \
compatible with each other within one standard deviation for almost all \
cases.\\nThis implies that, as expected, the dependence of the slopes of the \
chiral extrapolation on the discretization can be neglected as a higher-order \
effect in our computation, i.e.\\\\ assuming or not assuming the equality of \
$\\\\alpha^{(+,-)}$ and $\\\\alpha^{(+,+)}$ has negligible effect compared to \
statistical and other types of systematic \
uncertainties.\\n\\n\\n\\\\addtolength{\\\\tabcolsep}{-3pt} \

\\n\\n\\nIn Table\\\\ \\\\ref{tab:summary2}, we also compare cut-off effects \
for all the meson masses for the two considered discretizations.\\nThe \
expectation from previous ETMC investigations of light pseudoscalar mesons is \
that the $(+,-)$ setup has smaller discretization effects than the $(+,+)$ \
setup.\\nHowever, as we already mentioned in the case of $\\\\eta_c(1S)$, \
this is not always true.\\nOnly for five of the considered states, \
$|c^{(+,-)}|<|c^{(+,+)}|$ (within one standard deviation), while in two \
cases, $|c^{(+,-)}|>|c^{(+,+)}|$.\\nIn the remaining around 75\\\\% of the \
cases, $c^{(+,-)}$ and $c^{(+,+)}$ are compatible within statistical \
errors.\\nThus, the conclusion is that cut-off effects tend to be quite \
similar in both setups, with only a slight tendency for smaller \
discretization effects in the $(+,-)$ setup.\\nHowever, we confirm previous \
ETMC statements that for the states relevant for the tuning of the strange \
and charm quark mass (the pion, the kaon and the $D$ meson), cut-off effects \
are much smaller in the $(+,-)$ setup.\\n\\nFor the final results presented \
in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:summary}, our preferred fitting strategy is \
Strategy 2, a compromise that assumes universality of the continuum limit, \
but leaves independent slopes of the chiral extrapolation.\\nHowever, as \
detailed above, the uncertainty associated with the choice of the fitting \
ansatz has negligible impact on our final \
results.\\n\\n\\n\\\\subsubsection{Isospin breaking \
effects}\\n\\\\label{sec:isospin}\\nAnother type of systematic uncertainty is \
the breaking of isospin symmetry by electromagnetic effects (different \
electric charges of up and down quarks) and different masses of up and down \
quarks.\\nWe are not able to address this issue directly and rigorously, \
since it would require working in a 1+1+1+1 setup with different light quark \
masses and an inclusion of electromagnetism, which goes beyond the scope of \
the present work (for pioneering work regarding such computations, cf. \
Refs.\\\\ \\\\cite{deDivitiis:2013xla,Borsanyi:2013lga}).\\n\\nOne simple \
possibility to estimate the magnitude of these effects is to take the \
experimentally known difference of the masses of the charged and neutral $D$ \
mesons, which is $\\\\mathcal{O}(5)$ MeV.\\nAlternatively, we try to largely \
eliminate these effects by performing tuning of the strange and charm quark \
masses with either the neutral or the charged $\\\\pi$, $K$ and $D$ meson \
masses. \\nAs discussed in Section\\\\ \\\\ref{sec:tuning} and as indicated \
by the perfect agreement of our lattice results for e.g.\\\\ $D_s$, \
$\\\\eta_c(1S)$ and $J/\\\\psi(1S)$, we estimate the remaining systematic \
errors to be well beyond 5 MeV, which is negligible compared to the \
statistical errors and the fitting range uncertainties.\\nAs an example, we \
note that in the case of the $D^*$ meson (see Table\\\\ \\\\ref{tab:all}), \
our crude method of estimating the splitting between the charged and neutral \
meson masses by comparing results from different input $\\\\pi$, $K$ and $D$ \
meson masses for the strange and charm quark masses tuning, gives 4 MeV, as \
compared to the approximately 3.3 MeV experimental \
splitting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{\\\\label{sec:summary}Conclusions}\\n\
\\nOur final results are collected in Table~\\\\ref{tab:all} and in \
Figures~\\\\ref{fig:specD}, \\\\ref{fig:specDs} and \\\\ref{fig:speccc}. In \
Table~\\\\ref{tab:all}, we list meson names, $J^{\\\\mathcal{P (C)}}$ quantum \
numbers, experimental results according to the PDG \\\\cite{PDG} and our \
lattice QCD results, for which we show mean values, statistical errors, \
uncertainties associated with the choice of the fitting range and total \
errors (statistical errors and fitting range uncertainties combined in \
quadrature). For states with total angular momentum $J = 2$, always two \
numerical results are available, one from the $E$ representation, the other \
from the $T_2$ representation. In all cases, these results are compatible \
within errors. As final results we use the ones from the $E$ representation, \
because for those, contamination by $J = 3$ states is excluded. Similarly, in \
Figures~\\\\ref{fig:specD}, \\\\ref{fig:specDs} and \\\\ref{fig:speccc}, we \
summarize and compare our lattice QCD results (dark colored boxes represent \
statistical, light colored boxes total errors) to experimental results (gray \
boxes with black \
edges).\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}[p]\\n\\\\centering\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{lc|c|\

boxes).}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nThe $D$ meson \
($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 0^-$), i.e.\\\\ the lightest charm-light meson, plays a \
special role in our computation. The $(+,-)$ lattice QCD results are used to \
tune the valence charm quark mass and, hence, cannot be considered as \
predictions. The corresponding $(+,+)$ results are in excellent agreement \
with experiment (cf.\\\\ the first two lines in Table~\\\\ref{tab:all}), \
which is a convincing test of universality, but again they are not lattice \
QCD predictions of the $D^0$ and $D^\\\\pm$ meson masses. Moreover, we do not \
quote fitting interval uncertainties, since the effective mass plateaus for \
this state are extremely long and clear and the resulting uncertainties are, \
hence, negligible. The latter is one of the reasons for using this state for \
the valence charm quark mass tuning procedure discussed in \
Section~\\\\ref{SEC595}.\\n\\nFor $D^\\\\ast$ ($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 1^-$) as \
well as for $D_0^*(2400)$ and $D_1(2430)$ ($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 0^+$ and \
$1^+$; both $j \\\\approx 1 /2$, where $j$ denotes the total angular momentum \
of the light degrees of freedom), we find agreement with experiment. Since \
the latter two states are quite unstable, a more rigorous coumputation of \
their masses (and also widths) would require to treat them as resonances and \
use e.g.\\\\ the L\\\\\\\"uscher's method in combination with suitable \
four-quark creation operators. Such a computation, however, is significantly \
more challenging and computer time consuming than the methods used in this \
work, which are based on creation operators of quark-antiquark type only. A \
recent exploratory resonance study of $D_0^*(2400)$ and $D_1(2430)$ using a \
single lattice spacing ($a \\\\approx 0.124 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm}$) and a \
single pion mass ($m_\\\\pi \\\\approx 266 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$) can be \
found in Ref.~\\\\cite{Mohler:2012na}.\\n\\nThe resulting masses for the \
remaining two extracted states, $D_1(2420)$ and $D_2^*(2460)$ \
($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 1^+$ and $2^+$; both $j \\\\approx 3 /2$), are around $3 \
\\\\ldots 4 \\\\, \\\\sigma$ above the experimental results\\\\footnote{In \
this context, it is interesting to note that we have observed a very similar \
behavior for the corresponding $j \\\\approx 3/2$ $B$ mesons \
\\\\cite{Michael:2010aa}.}. We attribute this discrepancy to technical \
problems, in particular a not sufficently optimized choice of the meson \
creation operators (cf.\\\\ the $E$ and $T_2$ segments of \
Table~\\\\ref{tab.operators}) and thus a contamination of effective mass \
plateaus by excited states. This is indicated by our procedure to determine \
the fitting range uncertainties, which exhibits a systematic decrease of the \
extracted meson masses when using fitting intervals starting at increasingly \
larger temporal separations. Before an unambigous plateau is reached, the \
signal is lost in statistical noise. This interpretation is additionally \
supported when considering only gauge link ensembles with the finest lattice \
spacing (D ensembles). There, it is easier to identify effective mass \
plateaus, because a given temporal range in physical units corresponds to a \
larger number of discrete lattice separations. A chiral extrapolation from \
the D ensembles only results in masses compatible with experiment for both \
$D_1(2420)$ and $D_2^*(2460)$.\\n\\n% **********\\n\\n\\\\subsection{$D_s$ \
mesons (charm-strange \
mesons)}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[htb]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

\\\\label{fig:specDs}Chirally and continuum extrapolated lattice QCD results \
for $D_s$ mesons (dark colored boxes represent statistical, light colored \
boxes total errors; dark red/pink corresponds to $\\\\mathcal{P}=+$, \
blue/light blue to $\\\\mathcal{P}=-$) compared to experimental results \
(black/gray boxes).}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nThe overall \
picture for charm-strange mesons is quite similar. We have obtained very \
robust results for the $D_s$ ($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 0^-$) and the $D_s^\\\\ast$ \
($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 1^-$) in perfect agreement with experiment.\\n\\nFor \
$D_{s0}^*$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ ($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 0^+$ and $1^+$; both $j \\\
\\approx 1 /2$), our resulting lattice QCD masses are significantly above \
their experimental counterparts with fitting range uncertainties which seem \
to be well controlled. Similar discrepancies to experimental results have \
been found in other lattice QCD studies based on quark-antiquark creation \
operators \\\\cite{Mohler:2011ke} and in quark model calculations \
\\\\cite{Ebert:2009ua}. A possible explanation could be that both the \
$D_{s0}^*$ and the $D_{s1}(2460)$ have a structure quite different from an \
ordinary quark-antiquark pair, e.g.\\\\ a mesonic molecule or a \
diquark-antidiquark structure (cf.\\\\ e.g.\\\\ \
\\\\cite{Dmitrasinovic:2005gc,Cleven:2014oka} where such scenarios are \
discussed theoretically). It would be interesting to include corresponding \
four-quark creation operators into our lattice QCD computation and to see \
whether the masses of these two states decrease and the associated \
eigenvector components indicate a sizable four-quark contribution. In a \
recent lattice QCD study using both two- and four-quark creation operators, \
strong evidence has been presented that four-quark creation operators are \
essential to properly resolve these states \\\\cite{Lang:2014yfa}.\\n\\nThe \
resulting masses for the remaining two extracted states, $D_{s1}(2536)$ and \
$D_{s2}^*(2573)$ ($J^\\\\mathcal{P} = 1^+$ and $2^+$; both $j \\\\approx 3 \
/2$), are slightly above the experimental results, but still compatible \
within the total errors. Analogous to the corresponding $D$ mesons, we expect \
that an optimization of the meson creation errors could help to reduce the \
rather large fitting range uncertainty and thus lead to more precise \
predictions.\\n\\n% **********\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Charmonium (charm-charm \
mesons)}\\n\\n\\\\begin{figure}[htb]\\n\\\\begin{center}\\n\\\\\

\\\\label{fig:speccc}Chirally and continuum extrapolated lattice QCD results \
for charmonium (dark colored boxes represent statistical, light colored boxes \
total errors; dark red/pink corresponds to $\\\\mathcal{P}=+$, blue/light \
blue to $\\\\mathcal{P}=-$) compared to experimental results (black/gray \
boxes).}\\n\\\\end{center}\\n\\\\end{figure}\\n\\nWe were able to determine \
the masses of several states rather precisely and in excellent agreement with \
experimental results, including the $\\\\eta_c(1S)$, $\\\\chi_{c0}(1P)$, \
$J/\\\\psi(1S)$, $\\\\chi_{c1}(1P)$, $h_c(1P)$ and $\\\\chi_{c2}(1P)$ (the \
ground states in the sectors $J^\\\\mathcal{P C} = 0^{- +}, 0^{+ +}, 1^{- -}, \
1^{+ +}, 1^{+ -}, 2^{+ +}$). For the masses of the excited states \
$\\\\eta_c(2S)$ ($J^\\\\mathcal{P C} = 0^{- +}$) and $\\\\psi(2S)$, \
$\\\\psi(3770)$ (both $J^\\\\mathcal{P C} = 1^{- -}$), the total errors are \
larger, but results are consistent with experiment.\\n\\nWe were also able to \
predict three states, which have no established experimental counterparts \
yet: $\\\\eta_{c2}(1P)$ ($J^{\\\\mathcal{P C}} = 2^{- +}$), $\\\\psi_2(1P)$ \
($J^{\\\\mathcal{P C}} = 2^{- -}$) and a state with either $J^{\\\\mathcal{P \
C}} = 1^{- -}$ or $J^{\\\\mathcal{P C}} = 3^{- -}$. For the latter, we favour \
to interpret it as the third excitation in the $J^{\\\\mathcal{P C}} = 1^{- \
-}$ sector, as discussed in Section~\\\\ref{sec:ccT1}. These predictions are \
qualitatively similar to those from another recent lattice QCD study using \
only a single unphysically heavy $u/d$ quark mass ($m_\\\\pi \\\\approx 396 \
\\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$) and a single lattice spacing \\\\cite{Liu:2012ze} and \
with a calculation based on Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter equations \
\\\\cite{Fischer:2014cfa}. It should be noted that the fitting range \
uncertainties for these three predictions are comparably large. Therefore, \
the possibility of contamination by excited states cannot be fully excluded. \
We compare our results with corresponding chiral extrapolations from D \
ensemble data only, where effective mass plateaus can be identified most \
reliably. We find agreement in all three cases, which is reassuring and \
indicates that the total errors quoted in Table~\\\\ref{tab:all} \
realistically reflect the uncertainties of these three predictions.\\n\\n% \
**********\\n\\n\\\\subsection{Summary and outlook}\\n\\nWe have computed the \
low-lying $D$ meson, $D_s$ meson and charmonium spectra using Wilson twisted \
mass lattice QCD with 2+1+1 flavors of sea quarks and meson creation \
operators of quark-antiquark type. We were able to determine 5 $D$ meson \
masses, 6 $D_s$ meson masses and 12 charmonium masses, where three of the \
latter are theoretical predictions with no currently existing or clearly \
identified experimental counterparts. We have performed computations on nine \
different gauge link ensembles at three different lattice spacings in the \
range $a \\\\approx 0.0619 \\\\ldots 0.0885 \\\\, \\\\textrm{fm}$ and pion \
masses $m_\\\\pi \\\\approx 224 \\\\ldots 468 \\\\, \\\\textrm{MeV}$. \
Moreover, all computations have been done with two different valence quark \
discretizations. Using the resulting 18 mass values for each meson state \
allowed us to perform combined continuum and chiral extrapolations. These \
extrapolations seem to be very solid and trustworthy as e.g.\\\\ demonstrated \
by the corresponding plots for $D_s$ and $\\\\eta_c(1S)$ (which have very \
small statistical errors; cf.\\\\ Figure~\\\\ref{fig:Ds} and \
Figure~\\\\ref{fig:eta_c}). Similarly, we have performed computations also \
with two slightly different values of the valence strange quark mass as well \
as of the valence charm quark mass for each meson state. This allowed us not \
only to tune these quark masses precisely to their physical values, but also \
to crudely estimate electromagnetic effects. Finally, by comparison with \
analogous computations on another ensemble with rather small volume, we were \
able to demonstrate that finite volume effects are negligible. The masses \
collected in Table~\\\\ref{tab:all} and in Figures~\\\\ref{fig:specD}, \
\\\\ref{fig:specDs} and \\\\ref{fig:speccc} are listed and shown with a total \
error accounting for all these effects and, hence, can be compared to \
existing or future experimental data in a direct and meaningful way.\\n\\nWe \
were also able to clearly distinguish the two close-by $J^\\\\mathcal{P} = \
1^+$ $D$ meson states $D_1(2430)$ and $D_1(2420)$ and the two analogous $D_s$ \
meson states $D_{s1}(2460)$ and $D_{s1}(2536)$ according to their light total \
angular momentum $j \\\\approx 1/2$ and $j \\\\approx 3/2$. This is not only \
important when comparing with experimental results, but also when studying \
semileptonic decays $B \\\\rightarrow D^{\\\\ast \\\\ast}$, where $D^{\\\\ast \
\\\\ast} = \\\\{ D_0^\\\\ast(2400) \\\\, , \\\\, D_1(2430) \\\\, , \\\\, \
D_1(2420) \\\\, , \\\\, D_2^\\\\ast(2460) \\\\}$. Such decays are of \
particular interest, because there is a long standing conflict between theory \
and experiment (QCD sum rules, model calculations), the so-called 1/2 versus \
3/2 puzzle \\\\cite{Bigi:2007qp}. Recently, decays $B \\\\rightarrow \
D_0^\\\\ast$ and $B \\\\rightarrow D_2^\\\\ast$ have been studied on the same \
gauge link ensembles for the first time with non-static $b$ and $c$ quarks \\\
\\cite{Atoui:2013sca,Atoui:2013ksa}. Using the same techniques and the \
results on $D_1(2430)$ and $D_1(2420)$ presented in this work will allow to \
also include $B \\\\rightarrow D_1$. This in turn should provide important \
insights regarding the 1/2 versus 3/2 puzzle from theoretical methods based \
on first principles.\\n\\nOur future plans are mainly focused on studying \
specific $D$ mesons, $D_s$ mesons or charmonium states with a larger set of \
creation operators, including in particular four-quark operators of either \
mesonic molecule, diquark-antidiquark or two-meson type. Existing lattice QCD \
studies \\\\cite{Gong:2011nr,Mohler:2012na,Liu:2012zya,Prelovsek:2013cra,\\\
nPrelovsek:2013xba,Mohler:2013rwa,Ikeda:2013vwa,Lang:2014yfa,Prelovsek:\
2014swa,Guerrieri:2014nxa} strongly indicate that such techniques are \
mandatory for a rigorous treatment of certain mesons, e.g.\\\\ the tetraquark \
candidates $D_{s0}^\\\\ast(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$. We are currently in the \
process of developing such techniques, in particular to efficiently compute \
corresponding correlation matrix elements \
