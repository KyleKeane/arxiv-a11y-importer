# arxiv-a11y-importer
Deploys a webform that can return the equations from a LaTeX article on arxiv in MathML

My hosted version is sitting at https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/10f82ee8-946b-401b-8997-1906b87da404

This is just a quick and dirty app that I threw together as an exercise, it does pretty well on straightforward content, but it fails to find things that are inside of user defintions such as \ee for \begin{equation}

Please report any issues using GitHub, including a link to the article that doesn't parse correctly.
